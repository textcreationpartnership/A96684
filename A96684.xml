            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>GOD's making, and entring into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Man, I look upon as the mo≈øt Conde≈øcending act of Grace, that ever was pa≈ø≈øed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sons of Men. That the Almighty God ≈øhould form a Man out of the Clay, or Du≈øt, and then take him into Covenant with him≈øelf; It
<pb facs="tcp:132570:3"/>was ≈øo high a Dignity vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øafed, and Conferred, that can hardly enter into our thoughts with ≈øufficient ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: but that when the fir≈øt Covenant was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, God ≈øhould make a new Covenant, and not take the for≈øeiture of the fir≈øt, to his utter undoing, how much more great is his kindne≈øs! It ≈øhews the matchle≈øs and unconceiveable love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect that God had to the Sons of men. Methinks the hearts of men ≈øhould not (I ble≈øs God I hope I can ≈øay in the ≈øimplicity of my heart, that I cannot) but, not onely with joy, but exultation humbly adore this his di≈øpen≈øation towards us. What, that we ≈øhould be in ≈øuch a Covenant? which is e≈øtabli≈øhed upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Promi≈øes, laid on a better
<pb facs="tcp:132570:3"/>Foundation, yea the be≈øt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes, and the be≈øt Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: not only with man, but with him upon the account of the Mediator, a Covenant that ≈øhall never be broken; For God will never break it on his part, and he hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken that we ≈øhall never fin ally fall from it, yea that hee'l pardon all the falls that are out of infirmity from it, that do thereby violate it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the≈øe expre≈ø≈øions of <hi>taking hold of God's Covenant, and joyning our ≈øelves to the Lord in Covenant,</hi> are to my Soul, ≈øuch things as are better than a thou≈øand Cordials, to any ≈øinking, fainting heart, and through grace do, and ≈øhall Experimentally find more ≈øolid Satisfactory Comfort in, than in all things in the World; That ≈øuch as we are,
<pb facs="tcp:132570:4"/>≈øhould be ≈øo highly favoured, and befriended by the Great and Glorious God. Sir, the vindication of the lawfulne≈øs, and expediency of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians particular Tran≈øacting with God in this way, is the ≈øum of all the middle part, which occa≈øioned the prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this foregoing, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the la≈øt part of this ≈øhort Treati≈øe. To your ≈øelf and your good Lady do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this ≈ømall piece, as knowing that you have a through experience of the Truth which is contained in the following ≈øheets: And therefore not only upon the account of the honour, I ow you for the Multitude of kindne≈ø≈øes, and tokens of faithful love which ≈øince I knew you, I and my whole family have received from
<pb facs="tcp:132570:4"/>your ≈øelf, your gracious Lady, yea your whole family; which I ≈øhall forbear here to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on further, as knowing, that you de≈øire not any one ≈øhould (as you your ≈øelf do not) <hi>blow a Trumpet</hi> before you; But for Religion's ≈øake, and that Covenant-relation, in which you and yours ≈øtand allyed to God. I know not how to te≈øtifie and render dues of thanks to you, in any other or better way than this; if you ≈øhall continue to favour me, in accepting this ≈ømall te≈øtimony of love, and re≈øpects to your ≈øelf, and family, as I know you do not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, but al≈øo are per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of, and have embraced the Truth, and Priviledges herein pre≈øented to the World, I have attained the end in this Dedication.

                     <p n="1">I. There is <hi>Jo≈øhua's</hi> Propo≈øal and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:132570:12"/>Declaration of a double act of this people:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Choice of God to be their God, ye have cho≈øen you the Lord to ≈øerve him:</p>

                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:132570:12"/>O who will not ≈øay Amen to this Truth! Or take it thus; That it is the highe≈øt and greate≈øt duty of Chri≈øtianity, to chu≈øe God unto our ≈øelves, to chu≈øe the true God to be our God: ye have cho≈øen you the Lord. The an≈øwer of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before, and what is here ≈øaid of them, doth ≈øuit with the propo≈øal of <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> in the very letter, v. 15. <hi>chu≈øe you this day, whom ye will ≈øerve,</hi> &amp;c. Here, and before they have made God their chief and only choice. <hi>Ye are witne≈ø≈øes again≈øt your ≈øelves, that ye have cho≈øen the Lord to ≈øerve him.</hi> This is fully expre≈øt in the Prophet <hi>David's</hi> words, who ≈øeems to have done the very ≈øame thing. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Oh my ≈øoul, thou ha≈øt ≈øaid to the Lord, thou art my Lord, my goodne≈øs extendeth not to thee.

                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:132570:13"/>and to this choice he had made of God, he was re≈øolved to ≈øtick and ≈øtand, ≈øo far was he from chu≈øing others, or being taken from God, that he would not make mention of them, or any thing that concerned them. v. 4. <hi>Their ≈øorrows ≈øhall be multiplyed that ha≈øten after another God, their drink Offering of Blood will I not offer, nor take their name into my lips.</hi> So Gen. 28.20, 21. <hi>Jacob</hi> was flying from his Brother <hi>E≈øau,</hi> and he ≈øaid, <hi>if God will give me bread to eat and rayment to put on, the Lord ≈øhall be my God;</hi> if <hi>Jacob</hi> will take God to be his God upon the account of a little bread and water, and apparel, then ≈øure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we have greater encouragement to take him to be our God.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:132570:27"/>their works and lives, as tho≈øe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, Tit. 1.16. <hi>In works they deny him, being di≈øobedient, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good work reprobate.</hi> Even as tho≈øe whom our ≈øaviour taxeth, Luk. 6.46. <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and will not do the things that I ≈øay?</hi> Ju≈øt ≈øo we read of ≈øome that <hi>call God Father,</hi> and <hi>yet do as evil things as they could,</hi> Jer. 3.4, 5. whom the Lord reproves, as he doth to the ≈øame purpo≈øe the prie≈øts, Mal. 1.6. <hi>If I am a Father where is my honour? if I am a Ma≈øter where is my Fear?</hi> They ≈øeem to take God to be theirs in ≈øome of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned relations; yet for all that, their deeds and ≈øpeeches are as evil as can be, <hi>With their lips they ≈øhew much love, but their hearts are after their Covetou≈øne≈øs,</hi> Ezek. 33. With their lips only it is, and no more, not with their heart; they chu≈øe him with their lips, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øe him and ca≈øt his law behind their backs, in their lives.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Chu≈øe him freely to be your God, not out of Force. Many ≈øeem to be willing to chu≈øe God, but it is when they mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity leave the World; when they come to die and they cannot of nece≈ø≈øity avoid it, they can be without him no longer: If they could have the World in health, and ≈øtrength one day lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they would let God alone, till ≈øuch a time as death did indeed come. How great many of people never de≈øire to acquaint them≈øelves with God, de≈øire him not, chu≈øe him not, or get any intere≈øt in Chri≈øt, till they come to die, then ≈øeem to look after and chu≈øe him for theirs!

                     <p n="1">I. Motive. Now fir≈øt con≈øider what offers God hath made, and doth ≈øtill make of him≈øelf unto you. If you look on me to ≈øpeak in Gods name to you, then this is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:132570:30"/>the work that I have to do now, to offer God to every one of your choice; If you will be prevailed with to chu≈øe him. This is the work of the mini≈øtry of the Go≈øpel to offer God and Chri≈øt according to the tenour of the Covenant of grace: How doth he di≈øplay his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious excellencies in the Go≈øpel, to prevail with people to accept of him and embrace him! is not this the ≈øum of every Sermon? God ≈øaith in every Sermon chu≈øe me: is not this the intent of the Covenant of Grace which we daily preach, <hi>I will be your God, I am thy God, &amp;c?</hi> as much as if God ≈øhould ≈øay, I offer my ≈øelf to you, chu≈øe me to be your God, and I am yours. This is the ≈øum of the Covenant, and the meaning of tho≈øe words: God and the World ≈øtand by the Soul, ju≈øt as two Suiters to a per≈øon whom they are wooing, and are not we ready to joyn with, and chu≈øe the World rather than God? yea have we not often refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed God for the World? Oh Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren! I be≈øeech you that we may
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:132570:30"/>lay it to heart; hath not God ≈øtretched out his hand a long time, <hi>and no man regards? how oft hath he called, and yet hath been refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed?</hi> Prov. 1.24. and doth he not ≈øay to us as he did to I≈ørael?

                     <p n="2">II. Motive. Con≈øider how long God hath done this. How long have you lived? and how many Sermons have you heard? even ≈øo long and ≈øo often hath God offered him≈øelf to you: how long have you been a di≈øobedient and a gain≈øaying peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! though God hath ≈øtretched out his hand! <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.21. may

                     <p n="3">3. Mot. Con≈øider, they are no hard terms that God ≈øtands upon with us, but that we may chu≈øe him and embrace him. And if they be hard he can make them ea≈øy, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:132570:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>enable us to perform them; and to be ≈øure they be all for our be≈øt Good and advantage. What be they? the terms be, that you for≈øake the World, Fle≈øh, and Devil, and is not this for thy be≈øt advantage? nay but is it not? Stand, and Pau≈øe a little about it; no man is able to gain≈øay this. It is true, of him≈øelf no man can do this, but God can impower us to renounce them, <hi>and to ≈øay to every idol, get thee hence;</hi> as it is prophe≈øied, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 30.22. And becau≈øe the terms are not impo≈ø≈øible, nor unprofitable, but for our advantage; therefore we ≈øhould not ≈øtick at them, but chu≈øe the Lord to us. The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is much every way: the ca≈øting off the things to be for≈øaken for him is advantageous; and the chu≈øing of God him≈øelf to us is much more for our advantage: the for≈øaking of them is of great Good, in that it removeth from us that which is of greate≈øt prejudice to us,<note place="margin">Damnum ce≈ø≈øans; Lucrum emergens.</note> and the choice of God is the choice of the chief Good: So that here is the removal of the greate≈øt lo≈øs, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:132570:32"/>al≈øo there accrueth the greate≈øt gain. So then they are not hurtful, nor prejudicial terms that are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us at all, nor ≈øhall we fail of fulfilling the terms, unle≈øs it be through our own default; God will enable us, that we ≈øeek it of him. If a man did offer me a gift, upon ≈øuch terms as I was never able to accompli≈øh, I ≈øhould think that he did it, but to deceive and befool me; but that per≈øon that offers me a kindne≈øs, upon ≈øuch terms, that he will make me capable of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, I have ju≈øt cau≈øe to think he is in good earne≈øt: So it is with God; God can and will enable the Soul to reject all el≈øe, whereby it may be capable of chu≈øing, and enjoying him. He can give us, &amp; a≈ø≈øi≈øt us to do what≈øoever is requi≈øite in order to our acceptance of him; and further. I ≈øhall add in the clo≈øe of this, that it is impo≈ø≈øible without the≈øe, or upon any other terms to chu≈øe him, or have him to be ours; no having and cleaving to the World, Fle≈øh, and Devil, and yet having and chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing God to be ours too. You cannot

This is but doing the ≈øame thing in another way, which hath been already done, and that often (it may be) and many ways too, as to the ≈øub≈øtance thereof; for I take the≈øe things for granted, (1.) That every true Chri≈øtian hath done this already in his heart. (2.) That every per≈øon in the vi≈øible
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:132570:74"/>Church hath done this virtually in his Bapti≈øm, (as before) and in the primitive times, none were baptized without an expre≈øs Covenanting, wherein they renounced the World, the Fle≈øh, and the Devil, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged them≈øelves to Chri≈øt, and promi≈øed to obey him: I ≈øhall refer you for more (yet not much) of this to Mr. <hi>Baxters Saints re≈øt, Edit.</hi> 8. p. 149. <hi>Edit.</hi> 9. p. 143. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion was propo≈øed. <hi>Abrenuncias?</hi> that is, do≈øt thou renounce? &amp;c. An≈ø. <hi>Abrenuncio,</hi> I do renounce. Q. <hi>Credis?</hi> do≈øt thou believe? <hi>Credo,</hi> I do believe. Now if it was done actually by per≈øons aged at their Bapti≈øm, afore-time, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, and before others, though in few words, Why is it not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable to be done by any now, in a more full and large way either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, or privately in this expre≈øs way, here treated and di≈øcour≈øed of, as God ≈øhall incline the hearts of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among≈øt us? Further con≈øider, (3.) How often do men do it actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their own per≈øons at the Lord's Table? even as often as they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:132570:75"/>come to partake of the ≈øame. For what el≈øe is ≈øet forth by the≈øe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental actions of every Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in their participation, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing al≈øo a Sign and Seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they take God to? be their God, and Je≈øus Chri≈øt to be their alone Saviour, and every one doth this for him≈øelf, and by the ≈øame reaching forth of the hand, as he doth receive Je≈øus Chri≈øt unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, ≈øo doth he as it were give up the hand to God, and thereby his whole ≈øelf to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, (according to the former ob≈øervation,<note place="margin">Sup. ≈øcript.

                        </note>) to become one of his people, and Servants, thereby re≈øigning him≈øelf up to him, to be wholly his, and at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. (4.) How often do men do this al≈øo on their ≈øick-beds? their re≈øolution is very earne≈øt and ≈øtrong, and how often doth it i≈ø≈øue forth into expre≈øs promi≈øe? how apt are men to purpo≈øe and promi≈øe both, when death and judgment look them in the face? that they will become the Lords, are grieved that ≈øin hath ≈øwayd them ≈øo much, and that they have ≈øerved it ≈øo
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:132570:75"/>long, and if it ever plea≈øe the Lord to ≈øpare them, recover them, and continue them longer in the world, they will be only for the Lord, and for no other, that they will drudg for the World, fulfil the lu≈øts of the fle≈øh no longer, nor ever any more as they have done, <hi>make provi≈øion</hi> for it <hi>to fulfil them.</hi> The≈øe things are not only determined in mens brea≈øts, but uttered by their tongues, and with their mouths too, at ≈øuch a time: and is not this the ≈øame thing, the lawfulne≈øs of which we hereby labour to ju≈øtify and e≈øtabli≈øh? (5.) Nay further yet, we find this occa≈øionally done, by Gods Saints, upon ≈øome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary deliverance out of eminent and particular troubles. See this clear in the Prophet <hi>David's</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, P≈øal. 116.16. <hi>O Lord, truly I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant, and the Son of thine hand-maid, thou ha≈øt loo≈øed my bonds.</hi> The P≈øalm was penned as mo≈øt (and mo≈øt rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally too) agree, upon the ≈øame occa≈øion as <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 18. (as may be ≈øeen by comparing ≈øeveral ver≈øes of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:132570:76"/>that and this together): Now upon occa≈øion of this deliverance (which was from the hand of all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp; from the hand of <hi>Saul, P≈ø.</hi> 18. <hi>Title.</hi>) the Prophet breaks out into expre≈øs acknowledgment of his obligation to God; and of his own re≈øignation of him≈øelf to him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.

This is true, if it be ≈øuppo≈øed that God makes different Covenants as to the matter of them, as the Covenants of Works and Grace were; and this is the very ground upon which this pa≈ø≈øage was uttered, and that which it doth purpo≈øely drive at, it being ≈øpoken about the Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> and all mankind in him, and with Je≈øus Chri≈øt and the elect of God in him: For as <hi>Adam</hi> in the fir≈øt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, ≈øtood as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentative of all mankind, that ≈øhould de≈øcend from him by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Generation; ≈øo Chri≈øt in the ≈øecond Covenant of Grace, did ≈øtand as a publick undertaker, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half

                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 2. But this doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that God may enter into Covenant with many per≈øons, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and individually, that Covenant being the ≈øame with all &amp; every one of them: not only with the per≈øon of the repre≈øentative him≈øelf, but al≈øo with every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular per≈øon of that Collective bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy included in him; that is to ≈øay, every particular per≈øon of that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous multitude obliged to God, upon the termes of one an the ≈øame Covenant, in that common or publick per≈øon, may ≈øue out claim and appropriate, or apply to them≈øelves in due time the benefits thereof, and al≈øo, may particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tran≈øact with God, in an holy giving up them≈øelves to him, for the performance (through the ≈øtrength of his own grace) of that duty, to which they are bound in the participation of tho≈øe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.

                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:132570:77"/>And ≈øo with every particular elect per≈øon in the Covenant of Grace through Je≈øus Chri≈øt: the≈øe two do not interfere, nor cla≈øh one with or again≈øt another, <hi>(viz)</hi> God taking ≈øuch a number though never ≈øo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, or many, into Covenant in the repre≈øentative, and yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into Covenant particularly, and with every one of them apart, and in their own per≈øons, in≈øomuch that every one of them may be concerned to lay hold on it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound in the ≈øame terms with the repre≈øentative.</p>

                     <p>For the nature of that Covenant (as far as by reading yet I do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand) it is this: A Combination or joyning together of ≈øeveral Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, by mutual Con≈øent, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and expre≈øs Covenanting (to u≈øe their own very words) to walk together with ≈øuch a body of Saints; in a participation of all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. In regard of Affection to them, he is, and is ≈øaid to be Near to them. Lord help us to believe it, God's People ≈øometimes can't hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe it; you know the≈øe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom we by love account dear, we account al≈øo to be very Near to us. Dearne≈øs and Nearne≈øs are here Convertible. Now God's People are <hi>the dearly beloved of his Soul,</hi> Jer. 12.7. in Original but one word, I have given the dearly beloved of my Soul. [<hi>Heb.</hi> the love] into the hands of her enemies. And that is one of the titles Chri≈øt gives his Church, throughout the whole <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Solomon;</hi> My Love, my Dove, &amp;c. So near to him the Church de≈øireth to be, that <hi>Song.</hi> 8.6. ≈øhe prays, <hi>Set me as a Seal on thy heart,</hi> What is the meaning of that? in ≈øhort, love me dearly, and love makes as ≈øtrong an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:132570:94"/>on the heart as a Seal doth upon any thing, to which it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; ≈øhe de≈øires to be near the heart of Chri≈øt, and that his Love towards her may have deep impre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions there, as the names of the twelve Tribes of I≈ørael, had on the bre≈øt-plate of Judgment, which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron</hi> did bear on his heart, when he went in into the Holy-place. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.21, 29. Further, ≈øhe prays there, <hi>as a Seal upon thine arm, for love is as ≈øtrong as death;</hi> in which ≈øhe de≈øires al≈øo his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øion, and Affection. The Lord expre≈ø≈øeth the ≈øame thing in a like phra≈øe, to his Church: ≈øaying, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I have graven thee on the palms of my hands,</hi> I≈øa. 49.16. I remember the Lord makes u≈øe of one expre≈ø≈øion more, to ≈øet it forth by, the <hi>≈øignet on the right hand,</hi> and that is near, in place and affection too. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.24. where the Lord ≈øpeaks of <hi>Coniah,</hi> one of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ≈øaith to this purpo≈øe! <hi>As I live ≈øaith the Lord, though Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah the Son of Jehojakim, King of Judah, were their Signet on my

And that is the ≈øecond thing, God's People are his dearly beloved, and ≈øo they are near upon the account of Affection.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In regard of Relation to God, they are nearly related to God; there is a Spiritual kin, and alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his people, you ≈øhall find nearne≈øs and kin are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible in the Scripture. Lev. 21.2. <hi>But for his kin that is near unto him, that is, for his Mother, and Father, and for his Son, and for his Daughter, and for his Brother,</hi> and ver. 3. <hi>and for his Si≈øter,‚Äî That is nigh unto him,</hi> &amp;c. So that Kin and Nearne≈øs are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, words of the ≈øame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:132570:95"/>
                  <p> Now there is a twofold Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwen God and his People, which makes the Kin to be ≈øo Near.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By Regeneration and the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the Marriage-Covenant; and ble≈ø≈øed are the people, that are in ≈øuch a Nearne≈øs unto God!</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt by Regeneration, and the new-birth: that is one way the kin comes in, (if I may ≈øo ≈øpeak) and therefore you ≈øhall find through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Scripture, that they are ≈øaid to be born of God, and born again; and hence is it that all that are regenerate are called the Sons and Daughters of the living God, and who are nearer to us than our Children; the≈øe are the Children of God, being born of him. Joh. 1.12. <hi>As many as believed, to them gave he power, to become the Sons of God,</hi> How came they to be the Sons of God? ver. 13. ≈øhews, <hi>which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle≈øh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> So in the Epi≈øtle of <hi>John</hi> throughout, are they ≈øaid
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:132570:96"/>to be <hi>born of God:</hi> Now how near is the Father and Son, I need not tell you that are Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ents. So near is the relation between God and his People, 2 Cor. 6.18. <hi>I will be a Father unto you, and ye ≈øhall be my Sons, and Daughters, ≈øaith the Lord Almighty.</hi> What a Promi≈øe is this! he will receive them to be as near unto him, as he will receive <hi>his own Son that ≈øerveth him.</hi> And what a deal of Nearne≈øs of Affection as well as Relation is there in this ca≈øe, <hi>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath be≈øtowed upon us! that we ≈øhould be called the Sons of God.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1. You that are parents, think on this; when you ≈øee your Children in the ≈øtreets, or any where about you, Oh how are your hearts drawn out after them; learn hence, to be affected with the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, both of Relation and Affection, that is between God and his People; you cannot love your Children though your hearts run out after them, as God loves his Children; all the affection of all the parents in the World to their Children, is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:132570:96"/>but the drops of a bucket in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari≈øon of God's love to his people and his Children.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By Marriage-Covenant are they Near to God. And this is ≈øo near a Relation, that all other kin are to be left for this Relation; they that are married, as to their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the fle≈øh, are become one fle≈øh, ≈øo near they are, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.5. Ju≈øt as <hi>Adam</hi> ≈øaid of the woman, when God brought her to him, <hi>this is bone of my bone, and fle≈øh of my fle≈øh,</hi> Gen. 2.23. Beloved, Gods people are his married people, and they are his e≈øpou≈øed people; full of this is the Scripture in many places. 2 Cor. 11.2. <hi>I have e≈øpou≈øed you to one husband, that I may pre≈øent you a cha≈øt Virgin to Chri≈øt.</hi> Ho≈ø. 2.19, 20. <hi>I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth thee unto me for ever, yea I will betroth thee unto me, in righteou≈øne≈øs and in judgment and in loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulne≈øs, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 3.14. <hi>turn Oh back≈ølid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children, ≈øaith the Lord, for I am married unto you,</hi> I≈øa. 54.5. <hi>For thy Maker is thine husband, the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:132570:97"/>Lord of ho≈øts is his name.</hi> Oh what an husband is this! Every woman is apt to admire her own hu≈øband, but what an husband is this of Souls! Mark, how the Apo≈øtle doth improve this natural marriage to a Spiritual u≈øe. 1 Cor. 6.16, 17. <hi>What, know ye not that he that is joyned to an Harlot is one body? for he ≈øaith, ye ≈øhall be one fle≈øh,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>but he that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit.</hi> The Apo≈øtles de≈øign is, to take off people from Fornication, and the argument is taken from the de≈øign of God in Marriage: God made Marriage that there might be an union betwixt the Man and the Woman. Now pre≈øently after Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, for per≈øons to run away one from another, for a Man to make him≈øelf one body with an Harlot, it ≈øubverts the de≈øign of God in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and the Apo≈øtle improves it, in the next words, <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit.</hi> A Spiritual my≈øtical Union there is betwixt God and his People, and I hope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that heard and now read this, have experience and a≈ø≈øurance of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:132570:97"/>it, and the Lord grant that more may. And here al≈øo are both the Nearne≈ø≈øes joyned together, not only the Nearne≈øs of Relation, but of Affection: if the Affection be ≈øtrongly knit between the husband and the wife, there is no Affection ≈øtronger than that, and no le≈øs ≈øtrong and faithful between God and the Soul. All which ≈øhews, that they are related to God, as near as any Relation in the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I may yet add another Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is not ≈øo near as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that are already mentioned, though near al≈øo; that ≈øets forth this Nearne≈øs between God and his People: and that is that of Servants, God is the Ma≈øter, and his People are the Servants too; and ≈øome Ma≈øters and Servants are very dear one to another, a wonderful Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of Affection there is of ≈øome Ma≈øters to their Servants, and of ≈øome Servants to their Ma≈øters; though no Relation as to the fle≈øh by affinity, or Con≈øanguinity, yet they love them tenderly. I ≈øhall give you an in≈øtance of this in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:132570:98"/>Centurion and his Servant, Luk. 7.2. <hi>A certain Centurions Servant who was Dear unto him was ≈øick,</hi> and he ≈øhewed that he was dear to him in his tenderne≈øs of him, in that weak Condition he was; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying him≈øelf to Chri≈øt for him. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> is called the Servant of the Lord, <hi>Mo≈øes my Servant is dead,</hi> ≈øaith God, and you know that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion, <hi>Mo≈øes my Servant,</hi> is a token of the great Affection God had to him, and an high honour and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteem, that after he was dead the <hi>Almighty</hi> confer'd upon hm.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nay ob≈øerve, in the la≈øt place that God's People are as Near to him, and as Dear to him, as any of our Hou≈øhold, and Family are to us. And therefore are they called the hou≈øhold, and family of God. Eph. 2.13. <hi>But now in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, ye who ≈øometimes were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Chri≈øt:</hi> Compare this with ver. 19. <hi>Now therefore, ye are no more ≈øtrangers, and foreigners, but fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the hou≈øhold of God.</hi> Yea to clo≈øe up this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,

Chri≈øt hath a natural body, and a my≈øtical body, his natural body is that, which was made up of fle≈øh &amp; blood, formed by the Holy Gho≈øt in the Womb of the Virgin: But then his my≈øtical body are all Chri≈øtians, who are as really his members, as his Hands, and Arms, and Feet, and Eyes, and Legs were members of his natural body. Chri≈øt is the my≈øtical Head of his Church and every believer is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtical member of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: how fully yet doth the Apo≈øtle expre≈øs this, to the ≈øame purpo≈øe, Eph. 5.30. <hi>For we are members of his body,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:132570:99"/>of his fle≈øh, and of his bone.</hi> He ≈øpeaks of the Marriage-Union in the neighbouring ver≈øes, much like that of <hi>Adam</hi> concerning <hi>Eve</hi> his wife, Gen. 2. <hi>This is bone of my bone, and fle≈øh of my fle≈øh.</hi> But ≈øaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle, <hi>This is a great my≈øtery, but I ≈øpeak concerning Chri≈øt and his Church,</hi> ver. 32. Further, if you ob≈øerve the Nearne≈øs of relation they have to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, it will al≈øo appear how near they are to God. They are near to him, in regard of their kin and allyance to Chri≈øt too; He counts them in the neare≈øt Relation to him≈øelf, and therefore they mu≈øt be near to God by vertue thereof: ≈øee it in that full Scripture, Mat. 12.46, &amp;c. <hi>One ≈øaid to him</hi> (that is, to Chri≈øt) <hi>behold thy Mother, and thy Brethren ≈øtand without, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiring to ≈øpeak with thee.</hi> 48. <hi>But he an≈øwered, who is my Mother?</hi>‚Äî &amp;c. 49. <hi>And he ≈øtretched forth his hands towards his di≈øciples, and ≈øaid, behold my Mother and my Brethren.</hi> ver≈ø. 50. <hi>For who≈øoever ≈øhall do the will of my Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the ≈øame is my Brother and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter,

So that that is the fir≈øt regard, they are near to God on the account of Chri≈øt, <hi>(viz.)</hi> their Union and Relation to the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are Near to God, with re≈øpect to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt, in regard they are the purcha≈øe of his blood.

And we ≈øhall be wholly and fully brought nigh unto God hereafter, when we ≈øhall be brought into the Kingdom of God, where God &amp; Je≈øus Chri≈øt are, and we ≈øhall be with him for ever. Here are we brought nigh in regard of friend≈øhip, but not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that fulne≈øs of fellow≈øhip which we ≈øhall enjoy in Heaven. And therefore are we ≈øaid <hi>to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent from the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.6. <hi>while at home in the body.</hi> But there had been no enjoyment of God here, nor of the Kingdom of God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if Chri≈øt had not ≈øuffered, but now ther's both: this is the fourth regard, in which we are ≈øaid to be nigh unto God.</p>

And this the Apo≈øtle lays down by way of Encouragement and Coun≈øel in two places of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Heb. 4.16. <hi>Let us therefore come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help us in the time of need.</hi> And all this is ≈øtill upon the account of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt, becau≈øe <hi>we have ≈øuch a great high-Prie≈øt, that is pa≈ø≈øed into the Heavens.</hi> Hence it is that we may <hi>come boldly to the Throne of Grace.</hi> Compare with ver. 14. ≈øo Heb. 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full a≈ø≈øurance of Faith, having our hearts ≈øprinkled from an evil Con≈øcience.</hi> This is the great priviledg of Chri≈øtians, that they are made <hi>Kings, and Prie≈øts unto God, and his Father.</hi> Now you know the Prie≈øts under the law, it was their place, and office to draw nigh unto God; as doth appear by the≈øe two places of Scripture, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.3. where when fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

                  <p n="2">2ly, God will fellow-feel with you too, if you are a People near unto him, and this Priviledg is as great, as the former; there is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Scripture for this, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 63.9. <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Angel of his pre≈øence ≈øaved them; in his love and in his pity he redeemed them, and bare
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:132570:108"/>them, and carried them all the days of old.</hi> The Chapter ≈øpeaks of the works God had done formerly for <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> but principally with re≈øpect to the Wilderne≈øs, how pitiful was God to <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> when they were in the Wilderne≈øs! and how did God ≈øhew him≈øelf to be concerned, in all the Affliction that did light upon them, by a compa≈ø≈øionate Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling! If any be ≈øick, or in Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that be near to us, how ready are we to lay it to heart, how are we affected with it! ≈øo will God be with all our troubles, be they what they will be. And mark you, the ≈øame expre≈ø≈øion is ≈øpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our inward Affliction, and remember it again≈øt the time that trouble comes; it is ≈øpoken of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt; Heb. 4.14. <hi>Seeing then we have a great high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Prie≈øt, that is pa≈ø≈øed into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Je≈øus the Son of God. ‚Äî For we have not an high Prie≈øt, that cannot be touched with our infirmities, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without ≈øin.</hi> He was tempted to ≈øin, though he was not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:132570:108"/>prevailed over by the temptation, and therefore Je≈øus the Son of God, can be touched with the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our temptations. Sometimes the violence of temptation is ≈øo ≈øtrong, and ≈øo hard to be dealt with, that were it not, that a per≈øon could look to Chri≈øts fellow-feeling, and to God's pitty, it were a cau≈øe not to be undergon. I believe I ≈øpeak to ≈øome that under≈øtand, and experience what I ≈øay now; if we commi≈øerate tho≈øe that be Dear and Near to us, (nay and tho≈øe that be not ≈øo, but in the common bonds of nature with us) ≈øo that we take what hath befallen them, as though it had fallen on our own ≈øelves, how much more will God! and ble≈ø≈øed be God, that we are nigh to ≈øuch an one that can fellow-feel with us, if not, we were an undone people; that's the ≈øecond.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third Priviledg is this, the advantage they have of prevailing with God, in the reque≈øts they do pre≈øent to him; all their ≈øuits and reque≈øts ≈øhall be accepted and granted, and free and open acce≈øs to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:132570:109"/>his pre≈øence to ask any thing of him, and not be denied, ≈øtill asking according to his Will. And hence it is, that they are ≈øo prevalent with God, becau≈øe they are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple near to God, and becau≈øe they are ≈øo near to him, that is, ≈øo near to him that is the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt; hence it is, that they can have all their Payers an≈øwered, an da l their petitions fulfilled, becau≈øe they are a People near to God; the Lord is near to an≈øwer all their Prayers; the Lord increa≈øe our Faith, for herein lyes much of the comfort of Chri≈øtianity. You know if a ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger come to reque≈øt any thing of us, or an enemy, we do not ≈øo much as look on them, nor grant them (though it ≈øhould not be ≈øo with us, and we ≈øhould not do ≈øo) but if our familiar friend reque≈øts any thing of us, he will ≈øoon prevail; if a wife come, and de≈øire her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to do ≈øomething for her, or a Child ≈øhould de≈øire his Father to do ≈øomething for him, or give ≈øomething to him, though another ≈øhould not, yet they ≈øhall prevail,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:132570:109"/>why? Becau≈øe they be near to him. So it is with God, God's People are his Married People, his new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Children, therefore they have ≈øuch prevalence with him in all their addre≈ø≈øes unto him. They may ≈øreely, but humbly Conver≈øe with him, and may have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. God Commanded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.22. that there ≈øhould be a Mercy-≈øeat, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Mercy-≈øeat two golden Cherubims, and they ≈øhonld look one towards another; and when God did come and ≈øpeak to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the text tells us God promi≈øed, <hi>There will I meet with thee, and there will I Commune with thee, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Mercy-Seat;</hi> and hence the Apo≈øtle draws his encouraging argument, <hi>let us come boldly to the Throne of Grace,</hi> Heb. 4.16. <hi>that we may obtain mercy &amp;c.</hi> the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-Seat in the Old-Te≈øtament, is the throne of Grace in the New.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Their protection is ≈øure, God will undertake for their defence, which is much of the ≈øame impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the fir≈øt; therefore I ≈øhall ≈øay by way of addition little of it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:132570:110"/>here; their ≈øafeguard is ≈øure, becau≈øe God undertakes for them; They are as dear to him as the Apple of his eye, and he that toucheth you, toucheth the Apple of my eye, ≈øaith God, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8. and their ≈øafety is ≈øet forth by their Nearne≈øs to God, yea under the ≈øhadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, till the≈øe calamities be over-pa≈øt, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 57.1.

O God be merciful to a great many Husbands and Fathers, that have no Compa≈ø≈øion on their Wives and Children, but ≈øpend all they get, and undoe their poor families! but God is not ≈øuch an Husband, nor ≈øuch a Father, God hath laid a ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial charge upon Ma≈øters of families, that they ≈øhould provide for their own hou≈øhold; and if a man provide

Be ≈øure to have a care of that that will cloud your evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and a≈ø≈øurance of Nearne≈øs unto God, and put you in your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øions at a great di≈øtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from him. You may get a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but then take heed, you do not meddle with that which will cloud it: time was you rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in God as your God, and your Father, that your ≈øelves were his Children, taken into Covenant with him, and into his family, in the neare≈øt relation to him. And when you are near to God, you will be ever near to God: but yet you may lo≈øe your a≈ø≈øurance by your ≈øin; for that will ≈øet you at a di≈øtance again, it being a for≈øaking God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from him; and ≈øo cloud your apprehen≈øion of Gods affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, your adoption, and regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:132570:118"/>and acceptation, and thereby rob you of the Comfort of your condition and all your relation to God; therefore have a care of ≈øin, of all and every ≈øin what≈øoever, and ≈øpecially your own iniquity. Some per≈øons are addicted to ≈øome ≈øins more than others, ≈øpecially therefore take care of them, the≈øe will crack your peace, and cloud your eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: walk watchfully therefore, and labour to have an un≈øpotted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation; for the ≈øpots and ≈øins of a mans Conver≈øation will be clouds upon his Soul, and will blur all his evidences, and ≈øo break his Peace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Keep near to God as much as you can, and be as often with God as po≈ø≈øibly you can. Do not carry it ≈øtrangely towards God: be often in Gods Company, and frequent in his pre≈øence, often ≈øee his face, and draw nigh to him: my meaning is, be often in the u≈øe of Ordinances, and the Duties of Gods Wor≈øhip; ≈øpecially in Prayer, which is a duty wherein God and the Soul draw as near one to another as in any duty
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:132570:119"/>what≈øoever. Nobles are ≈øtill about the King, and if the King ≈øtir to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place without their privity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way they go, and po≈øt to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; ≈øo ≈øhould we, if God ≈øeems to withdraw him≈øelf: ≈øo the Church after her beloved, <hi>Song.</hi> 3. &amp; 5. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 63.8. <hi>My Soul followeth hard after thee,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Ble≈øs God for his di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhing Mercy, to you above many others, many thou≈øands in the World: how many are kept off, and at a di≈øtance ≈øtill, and what are you that you ≈øhould be made nigh to God, when many thou≈øands are yet ≈øo far off from him! I cannot tell you why it ≈øhould be ≈øo, only it is Gods good-will towards you; becau≈øe he will do it, therefore he doth it. There are thou≈øands and ten thou≈øands in the World, that have not this liberty to come near to God; they are in the ≈øame ≈øtate that ever they were, and enjoy not ≈øuch a Priviledg as this is; therefore ≈øhould we ≈øeriou≈øly con≈øider it. Mark what the Holy Gho≈øt ≈øpeaks, Deut. 6.7, 8. <hi>Thou art an holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:132570:119"/>unto the Lord thy God, the Lord hath cho≈øen thee to be a ≈øpecial peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto him≈øelf, above all people that are upon the Face of the earth. The Lord did not ≈øet his love upon you, or chu≈øe you, becau≈øe ye were more in number than any people, for ye were the fewe≈øt of all people; but becau≈øe the Lord loved you, and becau≈øe he would keep the oath which he had ≈øworn unto our Forefathers,</hi> &amp;c. and ≈øay within your hearts, why ≈øhould God deal ≈øo with me to bring me ≈øo near to him, and leave others in the ≈øame ≈øtate wherein they were born? let your heart be mightily affected with this Love of God, and kindne≈øs of God. Methinks I could dwell on the per≈øwa≈øion of people to this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they would be much more taken with the Con≈øideration of Gods ≈øpecial and di≈øtingui≈øhing Kindne≈øs towards them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. La≈øtly be ≈øure to be humble and keep low; and that upon a double rea≈øon. 1. Becau≈øe that though you are a people nigh to God, of his free Grace, yet there is a great di≈øtance and di≈øproportion between
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:132570:120"/>God and you; for though you are brought ≈øo near God, yet you are but Creatures: whereas God is the great Creatour, you are <hi>but du≈øt and a≈øhes;</hi> God is the infinite, holy Maje≈øty of Heaven and Earth. Now the di≈øtance that is between God and you, ≈øhould dwell upon your hearts, and make you keep in a lowly frame ≈øtill, and ≈øhould Create ≈øelf-aba≈øing thoughts in you ≈øo much the more: The Con≈øiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Priviledges, &amp; the Con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of God's great di≈øtance from us, ≈øhould increa≈øe our ≈øelf. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈øement. 2. And then upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our own ≈øinfulne≈øs we ≈øhould be humble before God. Micah. 6.8. <hi>What doth the Lord thy God require of thee? but to do ju≈øtly and love mercy and walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with thy God.</hi> See to it, that you do walk more lowly, and ≈øelf-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øingly, con≈øidering what you are, on both the≈øe accounts, although God hath ≈øo dignified you. <hi>Amen.</hi>
