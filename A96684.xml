            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>GOD's making, and entring into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Man, I look upon as the moſt Condeſcending act of Grace, that ever was paſſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sons of Men. That the Almighty God ſhould form a Man out of the Clay, or Duſt, and then take him into Covenant with himſelf; It
<pb facs="tcp:132570:3"/>was ſo high a Dignity vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed, and Conferred, that can hardly enter into our thoughts with ſufficient ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: but that when the firſt Covenant was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, God ſhould make a new Covenant, and not take the forſeiture of the firſt, to his utter undoing, how much more great is his kindneſs! It ſhews the matchleſs and unconceiveable love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that God had to the Sons of men. Methinks the hearts of men ſhould not (I bleſs God I hope I can ſay in the ſimplicity of my heart, that I cannot) but, not onely with joy, but exultation humbly adore this his diſpenſation towards us. What, that we ſhould be in ſuch a Covenant? which is eſtabliſhed upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Promiſes, laid on a better
<pb facs="tcp:132570:3"/>Foundation, yea the beſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and the beſt Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: not only with man, but with him upon the account of the Mediator, a Covenant that ſhall never be broken; For God will never break it on his part, and he hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken that we ſhall never fin ally fall from it, yea that hee'l pardon all the falls that are out of infirmity from it, that do thereby violate it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly theſe expreſſions of <hi>taking hold of God's Covenant, and joyning our ſelves to the Lord in Covenant,</hi> are to my Soul, ſuch things as are better than a thouſand Cordials, to any ſinking, fainting heart, and through grace do, and ſhall Experimentally find more ſolid Satisfactory Comfort in, than in all things in the World; That ſuch as we are,
<pb facs="tcp:132570:4"/>ſhould be ſo highly favoured, and befriended by the Great and Glorious God. Sir, the vindication of the lawfulneſs, and expediency of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians particular Tranſacting with God in this way, is the ſum of all the middle part, which occaſioned the prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this foregoing, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the laſt part of this ſhort Treatiſe. To your ſelf and your good Lady do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this ſmall piece, as knowing that you have a through experience of the Truth which is contained in the following ſheets: And therefore not only upon the account of the honour, I ow you for the Multitude of kindneſſes, and tokens of faithful love which ſince I knew you, I and my whole family have received from
<pb facs="tcp:132570:4"/>your ſelf, your gracious Lady, yea your whole family; which I ſhall forbear here to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on further, as knowing, that you deſire not any one ſhould (as you your ſelf do not) <hi>blow a Trumpet</hi> before you; But for Religion's ſake, and that Covenant-relation, in which you and yours ſtand allyed to God. I know not how to teſtifie and render dues of thanks to you, in any other or better way than this; if you ſhall continue to favour me, in accepting this ſmall teſtimony of love, and reſpects to your ſelf, and family, as I know you do not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, but alſo are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of, and have embraced the Truth, and Priviledges herein preſented to the World, I have attained the end in this Dedication.

<pb facs="tcp:132570:7"/>Author of <hi>Vindiciae Pieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> and another Ancient and able Divine, whoſe joint ſuffrage I looked on as a ſufficient encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to it; and indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conſent of Mr. <hi>R. A.</hi> I ſhould never have yielded to it, looking upon it as a thing too ſancy, and pragmatical with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, to adventure ſo to do, the thing vindicated being firſt expoſed and propoſed in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Book. And ſith I heard, that that way of tranſacting with God was queſtioned by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, both before, and ſince they were expoſed to his judicious Conſideration; Some looking on it as a new kind of Covenant between God and his people, whereas it is but the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, more particularly applyed and laid hold on; I thought it meet, as I was encouraged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what meditations I had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
<pb facs="tcp:132570:7"/>for the ſatisfaction of their judgments, and preventing thoſe miſapprehenſions they had about it. Some other things I had in my thoughts to prefix: but by a providence (ſomething more than ordinary) was more preſt in my Spirit, to fix my thoughts on this Scripture here inſiſted on: which when I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo ſuitable thereto, I could no longer forbear but ſet my moſt ſerious meditations on work to comply at once both with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and with the requeſt of my many friends, requeſting its Communication. The tranſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, though ſhort, yet would have proved tedious to the many that requeſted it, and I hope may bring ſome profit, and ſatisfaction to ſome into whoſe hands they may come; that never deſired, nor thought of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch thing: The only thing I
<pb facs="tcp:132570:8"/>have cauſe to be aſhamed of, is, the narrowneſs of my own heart, in handling a matter of ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and important a concern. I have deſired to ſpeak pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and briefly, and not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large by digreſſion, but what may prove moſt ſuitable to my main deſign. In Sermons, that are preach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, where there is only hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the time of Speaking, there need to be inculcating things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, as others of my Brethren know as well as I: affection's Dull, memorie's trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, and after-meditation too too much neglected. So that repetitions, and rehearſal, if they be not vain repetitions, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, prove beneficial very much to the hearers, from whom (their underſtandings being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhallow, for the generality of moſt auditors,) the heads, and material paſſages once named

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:132570:10"/>thing, of your chuſing God to be your God; only a little that you may take notice of the order, and connexion of the words. You may find in the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that holy <hi>Joſhua</hi> now going the way of all the<note n="*" place="margin">

In the <hi>14th ver.</hi> he gives them an exhortation, to behave themſelves
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:132570:11"/>anſwerably to all thoſe benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them, in a ſuitable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice towards him. <hi>Now therefore fear the Lord, and ſerve him in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and in truth, and put away the gods which your Fathers ſerved,</hi> &amp;c. and that he might the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally win upon them, he offers it as it were to their choice, v. 15. <hi>and if it ſeem evil to you to ſerve the Lord, chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve, whether the gods which your Fathers ſerved that were on the other ſide of the Flood or the gods of the</hi> Amorites <hi>in whoſe Land ye dwelt,</hi> and cloſeth up the verſe with his own holy reſolution, — <hi>but as for me and my houſe we will ſerve the Lord;</hi> he propoſeth to them others, if they thought they had deſerved better of them, than God had, by what he had done for them. The people ſeem with indignation (as they had juſt cauſe) to anſwer, and utterly deteſt the motion: and therefore give their full aſſent to the ſervice of God, on conſideration of the mighty wonderful works he had wrought for them. <hi>God forbid that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:132570:11"/>we ſhould forſake the Lord to ſerve other gods,</hi> v. 16. and they rehearſe his Works v. 17, 18. <hi>for the Lord our God, he it is that brought us up, and our Fathers out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. thereupon they reſolve, that they will ſerve the Lord only. Now <hi>Joſhua</hi> again that he might the better fix them in this their aſſent and choice, tells them that they could not ſerve the Lord, for he is an holy God, v. 19. that is, as they ought if they did not forſake their ſins, or other gods, and cleave to him ſtedfaſtly; then ſaith he, <hi>ye cannot ſerve the Lord,</hi> viz. accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and well pleaſingly. Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, with full and joynt conſent is reiterated v. 21. <hi>they ſaid nay, but we will ſerve the Lord.</hi>

                     <p>In them you may take notice of theſe two things,<note place="margin">Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the words</note> in particular.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. There is <hi>Joſhua's</hi> Propoſal and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:132570:12"/>Declaration of a double act of this people:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Choice of God to be their God, ye have choſen you the Lord to ſerve him:</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now the matter I ſhall cull out of theſe words to treat of, (paſſing by what elſe I might conſider in them) is the act of this people, in chuſing the Lord to be their God.</p>

                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:132570:12"/>O who will not ſay Amen to this Truth! Or take it thus; That it is the higheſt and greateſt duty of Chriſtianity, to chuſe God unto our ſelves, to chuſe the true God to be our God: ye have choſen you the Lord. The anſwer of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before, and what is here ſaid of them, doth ſuit with the propoſal of <hi>Joſhua</hi> in the very letter, v. 15. <hi>chuſe you this day, whom ye will ſerve,</hi> &amp;c. Here, and before they have made God their chief and only choice. <hi>Ye are witneſſes againſt your ſelves, that ye have choſen the Lord to ſerve him.</hi> This is fully expreſt in the Prophet <hi>David's</hi> words, who ſeems to have done the very ſame thing. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Oh my ſoul, thou haſt ſaid to the Lord, thou art my Lord, my goodneſs extendeth not to thee. O my ſoul, thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. the Prophet ſeems to entertain a ſoliloquy with his own ſoul, he had choſen God to be his God, and he was able to ſpeak it with the greateſt confidence to, and before God himſelf, which argues full aſſurance, <hi>thou art my Lord,</hi>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:132570:13"/>and to this choice he had made of God, he was reſolved to ſtick and ſtand, ſo far was he from chuſing others, or being taken from God, that he would not make mention of them, or any thing that concerned them. v. 4. <hi>Their ſorrows ſhall be multiplyed that haſten after another God, their drink Offering of Blood will I not offer, nor take their name into my lips.</hi> So Gen. 28.20, 21. <hi>Jacob</hi> was flying from his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>if God will give me bread to eat and rayment to put on, the Lord ſhall be my God;</hi> if <hi>Jacob</hi> will take God to be his God upon the account of a little bread and water, and apparel, then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we have greater encouragement to take him to be our God. The teſtimony of theſe two eminent Saints of God, are ſufficient to prove the truth; beſides the peoples act in the Text ſpecified.</p>

                     <p>Here ſeveral things conſiderable; 1. Some things precedent. 2. Some things there are wherein the eſſence of the act conſiſteth. 3. And ſomething that is the iſſue and product of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Somethings implyed as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The Choice of God doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a knowledg of God, that is a thing neceſſarily antecedent to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:132570:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>choice, that thing cannot be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen that is not known; ſo that the Soul that chuſeth God to be his, muſt know, not that God is only, but ſomething what he is alſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he hath revealed himſelf in his holy Word.

In all choices knowledg is prerequired. A man chuſeth not a perſon to be his Wife, that he knoweth not; no Woman chuſeth a man to be her Husband, whom ſhe knows not; a Perſon chuſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">II. There is required to a choice of God Converſe with, and ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of him. Therefore <hi>Joſhua</hi> rehearſeth here all that ever God had done for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:132570:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>to that day, in order to this Tranſaction between God and them. They had experience of God all their days, how much God had done for them. And <hi>Joſhua</hi> here recals them on purpoſe to draw them on to chuſe him, and ſix them in their choice. Deliberation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to every choice, and when a man doth deliberate, he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of things, and thereby debates within himſelf about the object of his choice, and hereby he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with, and hath experience of it: ſo when a man by the view of God in the glaſs of the Word, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately conſiders, and apprehends the excellencies of God, above all other objects whatſoever; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the more firmly fixed, and ſettled in his choice of him; raſh choices are often repented of, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p n="3">III. Choice of God doth alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a deſire after, and a love to God; this is apparent in nature, a man will never chuſe that againſt which he hath an enmity, or an Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; a man will not chuſe that meat, that he hath Antipathy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:132570:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>drawn up in love toward God, and enamoured with deſire after him, then it will chuſe him. The choice is of the Heart, if that be alienated, their's no cloſure with, nor choice of any thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe three things are anteceda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous to the choice of God, do go before it; now there be two other things, wherein the very eſſence of the Act conſiſts, and they are Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Appropriation.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The firſt of theſe (or the fourth in order to the former) is the Election, and preference of God above all: ſo that now all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are neglected, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued in Compariſon with God; thus <hi>David</hi> ſaid, Pſal. 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon the earth that I deſire, in</hi> Compariſon of thee. <hi>David</hi> choſe God becauſe he had God an Eſteem above all the World; <hi>q. d.</hi> Take all in heaven and Earth, yea Heaven and Earth themſelves, whoſoever will, ſo as I may have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:132570:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>God to be mine. Now doth thy Soul ſay ſo? ſo when Jeſus Chriſt is choſen by a Soul, <hi>all things</hi> elſe are but <hi>droſs and dung in Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Excellency of the knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.8, 9. It is a Chriſtians chief duty, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, eminently to prefer God, and Chriſt above all. Remember, that <hi>God is a Chriſtian's all, and his all is in God.</hi> And a Soul that is in ſuch a frame chuſeth God a right.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. (But the Second thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Souls actual choice conſiſteth), is Appropriation of God to a mans ſelf, a taking God to be his own, when we lay claim to God as our peculiar portion; as though there was no one that had intereſt in, nor relation to God but our ſelf on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So the Church, Pſal. 67.6. <hi>And God even our own God ſhall bleſs us.</hi> I do not know any ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion through the Scripture as here, implying ſuch ſpecial Appropriation. When the Soul takes hold on God, receiveth him and embraceth him as his own peculiar, as if he was his own, and none's elſe beſide. The

All created Goods are not ſatisfying Goods; though the Soul be a finite being, yet the deſires be infinite, and therefore whatſoever it chuſeth and reſteth in, it will not be ſatisfyed, till it come to God who is infinite.

                        <p n="2">2. In ſum to ſhut up all, we ſhould chuſe God to be unto us, as our All in All, our only Bleſſedneſs in this life, and that to come. It is propheſied of a people, (and is it not all our duty?) Iſa. 65.16. even of the Gentiles, <hi>That he who bleſſeth himſelf, ſhal bleſs himſelf in the God of truth;</hi> viz. in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending, and appropriating to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves God as theirs, they ſhould look on themſelves as the moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed people, (as juſtly they may) in all the World. There is no condition, that a man can account to himſelf as a Bleſſed condition, but when he hath God to be his God; he may ſing and rejoice in God (as though, yea) better than though he had all the World; he is, and he hath all, and whoſoever hath God to be his hath indeed all, and therein is bleſſed.

                     <p>THe Second thing we are to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; is, How we are to chuſe God to our ſelves, to be ours.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Chuſe him really, not feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and in outward ſhew onely; there be a great many that lay claim to God, and ſay God is mine, yet are they moſt proſane, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable; they ſeem to own God with their mouths but deny him in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:132570:27"/>their works and lives, as thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, Tit. 1.16. <hi>In works they deny him, being diſobedient, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good work reprobate.</hi> Even as thoſe whom our ſaviour taxeth, Luk. 6.46. <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and will not do the things that I ſay?</hi> Juſt ſo we read of ſome that <hi>call God Father,</hi> and <hi>yet do as evil things as they could,</hi> Jer. 3.4, 5. whom the Lord reproves, as he doth to the ſame purpoſe the prieſts, Mal. 1.6. <hi>If I am a Father where is my honour? if I am a Maſter where is my Fear?</hi> They ſeem to take God to be theirs in ſome of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned relations; yet for all that, their deeds and ſpeeches are as evil as can be, <hi>With their lips they ſhew much love, but their hearts are after their Covetouſneſs,</hi> Ezek. 33. With their lips only it is, and no more, not with their heart; they chuſe him with their lips, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him and caſt his law behind their backs, in their lives.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chuſe him wholly to be yours, that is, chuſe him as he offers himſelf to us, and as he is ſet forth
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:132570:28"/>in all the relations the Scripture makes mention of him to us; not only in thoſe Comfortable Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which-imply our priviledg, but thoſe honourable ones alſo, which imply and engage us to our duty; not to be a Friend, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and an Husband only; but a Maſter, Lord, and King alſo.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Chuſe him freely to be your God, not out of Force. Many ſeem to be willing to chuſe God, but it is when they muſt of neceſſity leave the World; when they come to die and they cannot of neceſſity avoid it, they can be without him no longer: If they could have the World in health, and ſtrength one day lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they would let God alone, till ſuch a time as death did indeed come. How great many of people never deſire to acquaint themſelves with God, deſire him not, chuſe him not, or get any intereſt in Chriſt, till they come to die, then ſeem to look after and chuſe him for theirs! They neglect, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe God in all his offers of grace vouchſafed to them all their lives;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:132570:28"/>but when they muſt part with all the World, whether they will or not, then at the hour of death will be ſeemingly forward to chuſe him. But they that chuſe him truely, chuſe him freely.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Chuſe God chiefly, let God be preferr'd before all, nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. If God be preferr'd as he deſerves, ſo it will be; He will be ſet before every thing in heaven or Earth. Let God be your chief deſire, <hi>your exceeding Joy, as</hi> Pſal. 43.4. word for word,<note place="margin">

As the Church had choſen Chriſt to be her beloved, and ſhe preferred him <hi>as the chiefeſt of ten thouſand,</hi> Song. 5.30.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Chuſe God only, if we can have nothing elſe with him, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him, yet let us chuſe him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he is God only, Good only, as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:132570:29"/>well as chiefly, and ſo let us chuſe him; let God be choſen, though we let all go to have him, and to keep our hold faſt of him. We do not know what times we may ſee, when we muſt part with all things; and if we be Chriſtians, as we have choſen, ſo we muſt keep cloſe to (bear with the expreſſion) a naked God, or God alone, without any thing elſe, as many, <hi>of whom the world was not worthy,</hi> have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Chuſe God for himſelf, have no Siniſter end in chuſing of him, not for any external thing he brings with him (as he never comes alone,) but only for his own Excellencies. What Excellencies are there in him! if we did but view them, according as they are diſplaied in the Word, what an attractive vertue might they have to draw our hearts to chuſe him! we muſt not chuſe God, as men chuſe Wives, and Women chuſe Husbands, for the moſt part for what they have, not for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; more for their eſtates, than for their perſons: he that chuſeth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:132570:29"/>God for any thing beſides God himſelf, chuſeth not God indeed, but that other thing in his Stead; he doth not chuſe God chiefly, and he that doth not chuſe him chiefly, doth indeed not chuſe him at all, but refuſe him.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Propoſing ſeveral Motives to provoke us hereunto.</head>
                     <p>HAving diſpatched the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going particulars, I come now to treat of the third, <hi>viz.</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to you ſome moving conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to ſtir you up to this ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Duty: and give me leave in a few words to expoſtulate with you, about this matter of ſo great Conſequence.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Motive. Now firſt conſider what offers God hath made, and doth ſtill make of himſelf unto you. If you look on me to ſpeak in Gods name to you, then this is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:132570:30"/>the work that I have to do now, to offer God to every one of your choice; If you will be prevailed with to chuſe him. This is the work of the miniſtry of the Goſpel to offer God and Chriſt according to the tenour of the Covenant of grace: How doth he diſplay his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious excellencies in the Goſpel, to prevail with people to accept of him and embrace him! is not this the ſum of every Sermon? God ſaith in every Sermon chuſe me: is not this the intent of the Covenant of Grace which we daily preach, <hi>I will be your God, I am thy God, &amp;c?</hi> as much as if God ſhould ſay, I offer my ſelf to you, chuſe me to be your God, and I am yours. This is the ſum of the Covenant, and the meaning of thoſe words: God and the World ſtand by the Soul, juſt as two Suiters to a perſon whom they are wooing, and are not we ready to joyn with, and chuſe the World rather than God? yea have we not often refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God for the World? Oh Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren! I beſeech you that we may
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:132570:30"/>lay it to heart; hath not God ſtretched out his hand a long time, <hi>and no man regards? how oft hath he called, and yet hath been refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?</hi> Prov. 1.24. and doth he not ſay to us as he did to Iſrael? Iſa. 65.1. <hi>I ſaid, behold me, behold me to a nation</hi> (and ſo to a perſon or people) <hi>that was not called by my name.</hi> And may he not go on to upbraid us as he doth there v. 2. <hi>I have ſpread out my hands all the day-long, unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts?</hi> Surely methinks God ſaith to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul the ſame words, and yet how hard a matter to win a Soul to be drawn to chuſe God, to be eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and betrothed to Jeſus Chriſt!</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Motive. Conſider how long God hath done this. How long have you lived? and how many Sermons have you heard? even ſo long and ſo often hath God offered himſelf to you: how long have you been a diſobedient and a gainſaying peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! though God hath ſtretched out his hand! <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.21. may
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:132570:31"/>not God's meſſengers ſay? yea may not God himſelf ſay? they will not be prevailed with, Rev. 3.20. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock; if any man will open the door, I will come in, and Sup with him, and he with me.</hi> Though Chriſt be kept out all day-long, till Supper time; yet if the door be then opened, he will Come in, &amp; Sup (converſe) with the Soul: yet for all that, though he ſo far condeſcends, how many perſons be there that will not open the door, as not all the day long, ſo nor yet at night neither! the worſe will be their condition one day: in how many Sermons, and Sabbaths hath God offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be your God, and yet ye have not choſen him to be your God to this day! and will not this come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account againſt you another day, if you ſtill continue to refuſe? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it will.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Mot. Conſider, they are no hard terms that God ſtands upon with us, but that we may chuſe him and embrace him. And if they be hard he can make them eaſy, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:132570:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>enable us to perform them; and to be ſure they be all for our beſt Good and advantage. What be they? the terms be, that you forſake the World, Fleſh, and Devil, and is not this for thy beſt advantage? nay but is it not? Stand, and Pauſe a little about it; no man is able to gainſay this. It is true, of himſelf no man can do this, but God can impower us to renounce them, <hi>and to ſay to every idol, get thee hence;</hi> as it is propheſied, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.22. And becauſe the terms are not impoſſible, nor unprofitable, but for our advantage; therefore we ſhould not ſtick at them, but chuſe the Lord to us. The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is much every way: the caſting off the things to be forſaken for him is advantageous; and the chuſing of God himſelf to us is much more for our advantage: the forſaking of them is of great Good, in that it removeth from us that which is of greateſt prejudice to us,<note place="margin">Damnum ceſſans; Lucrum emergens.</note> and the choice of God is the choice of the chief Good: So that here is the removal of the greateſt loſs, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:132570:32"/>alſo there accrueth the greateſt gain. So then they are not hurtful, nor prejudicial terms that are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us at all, nor ſhall we fail of fulfilling the terms, unleſs it be through our own default; God will enable us, that we ſeek it of him. If a man did offer me a gift, upon ſuch terms as I was never able to accompliſh, I ſhould think that he did it, but to deceive and befool me; but that perſon that offers me a kindneſs, upon ſuch terms, that he will make me capable of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, I have juſt cauſe to think he is in good earneſt: So it is with God; God can and will enable the Soul to reject all elſe, whereby it may be capable of chuſing, and enjoying him. He can give us, &amp; aſſiſt us to do whatſoever is requiſite in order to our acceptance of him; and further. I ſhall add in the cloſe of this, that it is impoſſible without theſe, or upon any other terms to chuſe him, or have him to be ours; no having and cleaving to the World, Fleſh, and Devil, and yet having and chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God to be ours too. You cannot
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:132570:32"/>keep the former, odious, &amp; unclean Trinity, and chuſe and take to you the bleſſed and glorious Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; <hi>No man can have, nor ſerve two Maſters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other, or elſe he will hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other; ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> Mat. 6.24.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Mot. Shall I ſay to you that you do not know what you chuſe, when you do chuſe God to be yours? I may well ſay ſo; for you do not know what you do chuſe, as to the benefit and advantage there is by him. You know not your own priviledg thereby; every one muſt ſay as Chriſt of <hi>Mary,</hi> Luk. 10.42. <hi>Mary hath choſen the better part:</hi> he that hath choſen the beſt, and chiefeſt Good hath choſen the <hi>beſt part,</hi> and therefore I will ſay again, you do not know what you chuſe, when you chuſe God; for</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) He that chuſeth God to be his chuſeth Life; God is the living God, and God is <hi>our Life and the length of our daies.</hi> Remember as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:132570:33"/>you would chuſe life for your Souls, chuſe God to be your portion; there is life, and life to be had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him, and will you not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with, for life's ſake to chuſe him?</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) <hi>God</hi> is light, and, he that chuſeth <hi>God</hi> chuſeth the light; and who that is wiſe would not chuſe the light rather than darkneſs? He is as he is call'd, <hi>the light of Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 10.17. <hi>The Lord is my light and my Salvation,</hi> Pſal, 27.1. <hi>God is Light and in him is no darkneſs at all,</hi> 1. Joh. 1. and <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to <hi>be the Father of Lights,</hi> James. 1.17. Yea <hi>God</hi> is a Sun, in whom is concentered all the light, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. who would not chuſe to be in the Sun-ſhine of his Face? Eccleſ. 11.7. <hi>Truely the light is Sweet, and it is a pleaſant thing for the eyes to behold the Sun;</hi> if ſo pleaſant to <hi>behold the created Sun,</hi> as who would not chuſe the Sun to ſhine, and to give light? who is it that would not behold the light of the uncreated Sun of Righteouſneſs? whoſe light would be more refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:132570:33"/>than ten thouſand Suns ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ſtrength.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) <hi>God</hi> is an exceeding great reward, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. what a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward do God's people chuſe in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to be theirs? God is he that will abundantly recompenſe thy affection to him, and all thine obedience to him, all your rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, and eſtimation of him. Whatſoever of theſe you have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to him, <hi>God</hi> will requite you, ſeven, nay an hundred-fold: every duty that you have perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>God</hi> will recompence it; all the pleaſure you have taken in him, and whereinſoever you have denied your ſelves any thing for him, <hi>God</hi> will make it up many-fold in this life, yea here, and hereafter too. And who would not chuſe ſuch a <hi>God</hi> to be his <hi>God,</hi> who is ſuch a great reward!</p>
                     <p>In ſhort what may I ſay more, he that chuſeth God chuſeth All at once, and I think no man will deny this to be the beſt choice. A man that chuſeth God, is like one that labours to graſp All at one gripe.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:132570:34"/>Even as that devout Nobleman of France ſaid, in return to his Friend, which ſent a letter to him, in which were inſerted theſe Words, <hi>Deus meus &amp; Omnia,</hi> My God and my all;<note place="margin">Monſieure de Renti.</note> you invite me thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the ſame to you, and to all Creatures, <hi>my God and my All, my God and my All, my God and my All:</hi> Be it known unto you therefore, that he is <hi>my God and my All;</hi> and if you doubt of it, I ſhall ſpeak it an hundred times over, I ſhall add no more; for any thing elſe is ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to him that is truely penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, poſſeſſed with, and aſſured of <hi>my God and my All,</hi> &amp;c. Oh that thouſands more had made (and could aſſure themſelves that they had made) this choice! that they might an hundred times over ſay with the ſame confident aſſurance; <hi>my God and my All.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Mot. Conſider, how freely God chuſeth you, and would, had ye hearts to chuſe and embrace him; and will you not anſwer God in his choice? there is no ſuch hard matter to prevail with him, for his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:132570:34"/>choice and acceptance of us, all the difficulty is on our ſide. Shall not we be as ready to chuſe him, if he be ſo free to chuſe us? he would chuſe us, if we were not backward and unwilling; yea though altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unwilling, how doth he draw the heart, and makes us willing in the day of his power! which ſhews his ſuperabundant grace, ſo freely diſpenſed to us, in fixing his choice on us, till he hath prepared our hearts, not only to a fixed reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to an actual choice of him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Mot. As an improvement of the former, Conſider, if you chuſe God, this will evidence to you that God hath choſen you unto himſelf from all eternity; for your choice of God in time, is but a fruit of his fore-choice of you: therefore I muſt ſay as, 1. Joh. 4.19. <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> So we chuſe him; becauſe he firſt choſe us: So our Saviour ſaith very ſuitable to this purpoſe, Joh. 15.16. <hi>Ye have not choſen me</hi> (that is firſt)
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:132570:35"/>but I have choſen you. Obſerve this, that that perſon that God hath choſen from all eternity, will, and ſhall in time chuſe <hi>God</hi> to be his <hi>God;</hi> and he that doth in time chuſe God to be his God, was from all eternity, before the Foundation of the World was laid, choſen to be one of God's people. Oh who would not make ſure of this to himſelf, and manifeſt this before all the World, that he hath choſen, and that he is choſen of <hi>God</hi> to be of the number of his peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple!</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Mot. Again, Conſider yet further, that whatever there is that may provoke to a choice, is moſt eminently to be found in God. If beauty, honour, greatneſs, riches, faithfulneſs, bleſſedneſs, love, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, may be ſufficient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to prevail with us to chuſe God, here's enough of all theſe; and how could I wiſh for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and tongue, and pen of the higheſt Angel, that I may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and expreſs, ſuch deep things of God as theſe be! 1.

If Bleſſedneſs, Oh the infinite glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, eternal Bleſſedneſs of God! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.12. Is he not <hi>God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſod for ever?</hi> Rom. 5. he is the bleſſed, and the bleſſing of God, the Fountain of all bleſſedneſs: O at laſt let ſome, or all theſe things prevail with you, to chuſe him to be your God!

                     <p n="8">8. Mot. Conſider, moreover, if you chuſe God to be your God, you ſhall be ſure here to enjoy your choice, which as it is the beſt, and moſt bleſſed enjoyment of all in Heaven or Earth; ſo whatſoever we chuſe elſewhere, we may miſs of, and go without the enjoyment of it; as well if it be a mean thing, as if it be the more excellent in and among theſe low contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible things of this world; yea and of the loweſt of them we cannot chuſe and take: But I dare in the name of God, to make this offer to any perſon whomſoever, that if he chuſe really, and unfeignedly God to be his <hi>God,</hi> as he ought, chuſe him and take him; chuſe him and he will become thine, thou haſt him as thine own, and ſhalt enjoy

                     <p>Oh Bleſſed God, wilt thou ever ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch poor Creatures to turn their back upon thee! ſtill to hold faſt their wickedneſs, and always to let thee go? how long wilt thou ſuffer
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:132570:41"/>them to belch out their malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, to thy very face, who art ſo infinitely glorious in Holineſs? how long ſhall they be ſpitting their Venom thus at thee? When ſhall they learn to chuſe thee the chief Good, &amp; refuſe the evil? When wilt thou encline their hearts to thee? Oh Lord, pluck off the Scales from their eyes, perſwade their obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hearts, that at laſt they may chuſe thee the Lord to them, that they may love the name of the Lord, and be his Servants, and chuſe the things that pleaſe thee, and take hold of thy Covenant! Lord, let the reading of theſe few lines prevail with one heart, if it pleaſe thee, to take hold of thee! Oh, that one Soul by this my weak labour, might be brought to chuſe and embrace thee, and to ſay with Thomas, <hi>my Lord, and my God!</hi>

                        <p n="3">3. Exhortation. Having choſen God, never repent of your choice. You may repent of chuſing the World, becauſe that may be hurtful unto you: but we can never have cauſe, juſtly to repent of chuſing God to be ours; are not the things of the World compared, and that fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Briars and Thorns? and hath not a Thorn coſt and loſt many a man a Limo, yea his very life? how many have ventured their Souls for the World! though our Saviour ſaith, <hi>What will it profit a man to gain the whole World, and loſe his Soul? or what ſhall a man give in Exchange for his Soul?</hi> alwaies there is danger in chuſing other things, but never any danger in chuſing God to be ours.

                     <p>Now about our particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into, and being in Covenant with God, divers things are to be weighed, and conſidered, for a right underſtanding thereof.</p>
                     <p>We may be ſaid, to be in, and to enter into Covenant with God, two waies.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Virtually; and this is two waies.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Either in our Fathers relation and obligation to God; God enters into Covenant not with Believers perſons only (as before) but with them and their Seed alſo. Gen. 17.7. <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between mee, and thee, and thy Seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and thy Seed after thee.</hi> And every Believer ought to accept the Covenant, not for himſelf only, but for his ſeed. Now my Father's accepting the Covenant, not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only, but for me, and God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:132570:59"/>with me as well as with him; doth engage me with him to God in the ſame obligation. This way of Covenant-tranſaction hath been always in all Gods dealings with the Sons of men in this kind, even in both Covenants <hi>(viz,)</hi> that of Works (called a Covenant of life by our Divines) before the fall, and that of Grace, ever ſince. And this way of being in Covenant with God, may be as ſoon as a man is conceived, and before while he is in his fathers Loins; thus were all the Sons of men (all mankind) in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's</hi> Covenant, and every beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Seed in their Fathers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Or elſe in our being baptized and receiving thereby the outward ſign, and Seal of the Covenant of Grace. Now though hereby an outward application of the ſign of the Covenant was made to us, yet we did but virtually enter then, and thereby into Covenant with God, becauſe we were altogether paſſive, and not at all active in our partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of that Sacrament.</p>

Something reſpects the nature of the thing it ſelf, that there be a ſerious, cordial, total Reſignation of our ſelves to God, in a holy depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, reliance, and affiance on all his Promiſes, accepting him to be our Saviour, the Holy Ghoſt to be our God, and Jeſus Chriſt to be our Sanctifier, and Comforter, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own terms: as he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to us, in his bleſſed Word, with an unfeigned, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p n="1">1. That I make theſe two laſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately forenamed, only as the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of this matter, not at all of the ſubſtance of our entring into Covenant. We may truely be in Covenant, partake of the benefits of it, have an intereſt in God, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, Remiſſion of Sins, and Salvation, yield our ſelves to God, although we do neither of theſe laſt things forementioned: that is to ſay, though we are never brought into the Congregation, there openly to profeſs our taking theſe obligations upon our ſelves, which our Father did for us at our Baptiſm, or never have ſuch a draught in expreſs writing, between God and our ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="3">3. All cannot do this, taking only one expreſſion in the letter, (that is) ſubſcribe with the hand; for very many cannot write, therefore cannot ſubſcribe with the hand to God: And if it ſhould be drawn for them, they may ſet their hands to they know not what, and ſo, if they ſhould ſubſcribe by ſetting their mark, (it's poſſible) they may be deluded therein, they being not capable, (being not able to read write-hand nor themſelves to write) to know what they do.</p>

Of this Covenanting between God and his people by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, we may ſee a lively deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Exod. 24.4.8. <hi>And Moſes wrote all the words of the Lord, and roſe up early in the morning, and builded an Altar, under the hill, and</hi> 12 <hi>pillars according to the</hi> 12 <hi>tribes of Iſrael.</hi> 5. <hi>And he ſent young men of the Children of Iſrael, which offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red burnt-offerings, and ſanctified peace-offerings, of Oxen unto the Lord</hi>—7. <hi>And he took the book of the Covenant and read in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the people, and they ſaid, all that the Lord hath ſaid, will we do and be obedient.</hi> 8.

                     <p n="6">6. It's Conſiderable, how much Gods tranſaction with the Sons of men in this kind, and way is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of and uttered, in the terms, and under the notion of ſingle and particular perſons. (1.) They were particularly numbred out to Jeſus Chriſt, and accordingly returned by tale (as I may ſay) to the Father by the Son.

(3.) In the precepts of the moral law at mount Sinai, (which all ſound Divines hold, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg to be a Covenant of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:132570:67"/>grace,) with <hi>Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 20. the Lord ſpeaks particularly, thou ſhalt and thou ſhalt not, not ye but thou. (4.) The Covenant with Chriſt (Myſtical) mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. is expreſſed in Terms of particularity. Now to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, were the Promiſes made; he ſaith not, and to his Seeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy Seed, which is Chriſt: now though by Chriſt, here is not meant Chriſt's ſingle perſon, but Chriſt myſtical (a collective term; As 1 Cor. 12.12. <hi>So alſo is Chriſt</hi> that is Chriſt's myſtical body, of which he is the Head) yet this may ſhew and point out to us, by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and proportion, that every believer hath intereſt in, and ſhould accordingly make particular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, of the whole of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant unto themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Becauſe the Holy Ghoſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranteth this in his own expreſſion. See 1 Cor. 12.27. <hi>Now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</hi> Our tranſacting with God this way is to that end and purpoſe, that we may make ſure of an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt

                     <p n="8">8. If the Devil, in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants he makes with perſons, doth make every particular perſon, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe with his hand, yea and ſome (I have heard, or read, or both) with their own blood, their reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of themſelves to him, in that helliſh bond they are tyed to him in: may we not then, yea how much more, are we bound to deal particularly with God, to make him ſure to us and our ſelves ſure to him?</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The expreſſions and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances by which this Covenanting with God is ſet forth, do imply and import as much as this is (1.)

Surely this is but half-marriage, the promiſe of the one party; or rather doth not the wiſe alſo engage by word of mouth, that ſhe will be a loving, faithful, and obedient wife? and then the marriage is full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat: In like manner as God, the huſband of his people promiſeth to be their God; ſo the eſpouſed Soul promiſeth to be only for God, and Jeſus Chriſt and for none elſe, and this ought every particular Soul to do which is the ſpouſe of the Lord Jeſus. <hi>I have betrothed you unto one husband,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle Paul,<note n="*" place="margin">Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is the Soul's Eſpouſal,</note> 2 Cor. 11.

So alſo in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supper wherein every perſon takes both the Elements, the Bread and the Cup into his own hand, denoting his receiving Chriſt to himſelf in particular, and giving up himſelf to him, both receiving, and reſigning himſelf up back again is implyed thereby.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, that it is expedient, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and advantageous, appears very plainly by theſe things follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The perſon gets true, and full aſſurance that the work is once done indeed, ſo that the matter will no longer hang in doubt, or if there be any doubts, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections ariſe at any time, this draught will be a teſtimony of it, which God will never diſown, it being done in ſincerity of heart, or
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:132570:70"/>if not this way, yet if there hath been a tranſacting by word of mouth, wherein an intereſt in God hath been humbly and heartily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and embraced, and ſerious giving up our ſelves to God totally and for ever; I ſay, if it hath been done in this manner the Soul will have ſome ground of evidence, and ſome plea with God, when in the midſt of detections and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This puts me in mind of one poor Soul, that was in a mixture of Soul and bodily diſtraction to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; who though then as not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, in many things and caſes ſenſible, yet being ſet to prayer by ſome perſons that viſited her, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome were Miniſters, and I my ſelf was one, ſhe made uſe of this paſſage in theſe words or to this effect; Lord,<note place="margin">Expreſſing here her came.</note> thou knoweſt me poor by name, and thou knoweſt that in ſuch a place (naming it both Houſe and Room) I had Communion with thee, and thou didſt give me aſſurance of intereſt in thee, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thine. And ſoon after through her bodily diſtraction taken off
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:132570:71"/>from the duty, and diverted: So that this is one beneficial advantage, that comes by it, that the work is ſurely and irrevocably done, and ſo ſhall be able with humble boldneſs to plead with God for our acceptance with him in any Soul-diſtreſſes we are, or may come into; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once thus in good earneſt done, ſhall never be undone, for that <hi>the gifts and calling of God are without repentance,</hi> Rom. 11.33. and though we are a people, that ſhall while we are in the World, through infirmity break Covenant, yet it is God's Covenant-promiſe, <hi>to forgive our iniquities; and remember our ſins no more,</hi> Jer. 31.3.4. And it is not every infirmity, that ſhall utterly disannul this Covenant, and break off this marriage-Covenant, and diſſolve this marriage-knot: ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. throughout; If we hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and mournfully return to him, as <hi>ver,</hi> 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For God is a God that keeps Covenant, and mercy to a thouſand Generations, to them that love him and (make it their whole bent and endeavour to)

How will this quicken us when we be ſluggiſh, and backward, and our hearts dull, and ſlow in our ſaith &amp; dependence, &amp; in our holy Converſation and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? if any thing in the World
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:132570:72"/>will draw on the Soul that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, or drawing back, this will do much, to conſider how we have bound our ſelves, and that if we prove not ſtedfaſt in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, both our tongues and our hands will witneſs againſt us; and that this will be, as it were an hand-writing, (of our own act and deed) another day againſt us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This will be a ſtrong motive to keep the heart off more firmly from, and againſt all ſin; for this is the firſt thing that is done in this ſo ſolemn a work, even to renounce all others that have been as the Lords of, and over the Soul. Say as the Church did Iſa. 26.13. <hi>O Lord our God, other Lords beſides thee have had dominion over us; but by thee onely, will we make mention of thy name.</hi> The Conſideration of the miſchief of which, was the great motive to draw her to the diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, inſomuch, that theſe two things laid together, will make the perſon that laies them to heart, reſolve, to follow the Apoſtles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.

All our unwillingneſs to come unto and before God, will be taken away, and our boldneſs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him to the throne of grace will be increaſed: yea it will breed an earneſt longing to be in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him: for though <hi>two can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk together except they be agreed;</hi> yet they can meet and walk delightfully together, when they are agreed. All that loathneſs and ſhieneſs will be taken out from us, and we ſhall be brought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his preſence: See it in <hi>David</hi> who could ſay God was his God, he could alſo long to come and appear before God <hi>as the hart panteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

It is enough that it is warranted by the practice, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Saints of God, in the Word, (which is proved abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſecond Scripture-evidence, <hi>Sup. p.</hi> 16. Where it hath been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhewed that God's Saints have particularly owned God, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated him unto themſelves, as their own God: Pſal. 67.6. <hi>God even our own God ſhall bleſs us;</hi> and have alſo engaged themſelves to God, in a particular manner in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and obedience, which is ground enough for ſuch a practice.</p>

I grant that we are not bound to this external formal doing of it, in ſuch a manner, as a matter that is neceſſary to Salvation, ſo as that every Chriſtian muſt of neceſſity do it, if he ever means to go to Heaven, or partake of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Covenant (this hath been ſpoken to before alſo) but as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent expedient, for the comfort of our Souls, in aſſuring our ſelves of the partaking of the benefits of the Covenant, and keeping the heart more firm and cloſe to God, in an holy Covenant-Converſation, and walking in order to Salvation.</p>

This is but doing the ſame thing in another way, which hath been already done, and that often (it may be) and many ways too, as to the ſubſtance thereof; for I take theſe things for granted, (1.) That every true Chriſtian hath done this already in his heart. (2.) That every perſon in the viſible
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:132570:74"/>Church hath done this virtually in his Baptiſm, (as before) and in the primitive times, none were baptized without an expreſs Covenanting, wherein they renounced the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themſelves to Chriſt, and promiſed to obey him: I ſhall refer you for more (yet not much) of this to Mr. <hi>Baxters Saints reſt, Edit.</hi> 8. p. 149. <hi>Edit.</hi> 9. p. 143. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was propoſed. <hi>Abrenuncias?</hi> that is, doſt thou renounce? &amp;c. Anſ. <hi>Abrenuncio,</hi> I do renounce. Q. <hi>Credis?</hi> doſt thou believe? <hi>Credo,</hi> I do believe. Now if it was done actually by perſons aged at their Baptiſm, afore-time, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, and before others, though in few words, Why is it not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable to be done by any now, in a more full and large way either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, or privately in this expreſs way, here treated and diſcourſed of, as God ſhall incline the hearts of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amongſt us? Further conſider, (3.) How often do men do it actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their own perſons at the Lord's Table? even as often as they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:132570:75"/>come to partake of the ſame. For what elſe is ſet forth by theſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental actions of every Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in their participation, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo a Sign and Seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they take God to? be their God, and Jeſus Chriſt to be their alone Saviour, and every one doth this for himſelf, and by the ſame reaching forth of the hand, as he doth receive Jeſus Chriſt unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo doth he as it were give up the hand to God, and thereby his whole ſelf to Jeſus Chriſt, (according to the former obſervation,<note place="margin">Sup. ſcript. Arg. <hi>10</hi>
                        </note>) to become one of his people, and Servants, thereby reſigning himſelf up to him, to be wholly his, and at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. (4.) How often do men do this alſo on their ſick-beds? their reſolution is very earneſt and ſtrong, and how often doth it iſſue forth into expreſs promiſe? how apt are men to purpoſe and promiſe both, when death and judgment look them in the face? that they will become the Lords, are grieved that ſin hath ſwayd them ſo much, and that they have ſerved it ſo
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:132570:75"/>long, and if it ever pleaſe the Lord to ſpare them, recover them, and continue them longer in the world, they will be only for the Lord, and for no other, that they will drudg for the World, fulfil the luſts of the fleſh no longer, nor ever any more as they have done, <hi>make proviſion</hi> for it <hi>to fulfil them.</hi> Theſe things are not only determined in mens breaſts, but uttered by their tongues, and with their mouths too, at ſuch a time: and is not this the ſame thing, the lawfulneſs of which we hereby labour to juſtify and eſtabliſh? (5.) Nay further yet, we find this occaſionally done, by Gods Saints, upon ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary deliverance out of eminent and particular troubles. See this clear in the Prophet <hi>David's</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, Pſal. 116.16. <hi>O Lord, truly I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant, and the Son of thine hand-maid, thou haſt looſed my bonds.</hi> The Pſalm was penned as moſt (and moſt rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally too) agree, upon the ſame occaſion as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. (as may be ſeen by comparing ſeveral verſes of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:132570:76"/>that and this together): Now upon occaſion of this deliverance (which was from the hand of all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp; from the hand of <hi>Saul, Pſ.</hi> 18. <hi>Title.</hi>) the Prophet breaks out into expreſs acknowledgment of his obligation to God; and of his own reſignation of himſelf to him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. Now all theſe things being conſidered, and ſeriouſly laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may we not reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that a perſon upon delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and weighty conſideration, may take any ſuch form of words, as are drawn up by either of theſe ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Divines Mr. <hi>G.</hi> or Mr. <hi>A.</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, or any that they may draw up themſelves from their own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, according to the Scripture, and having done the preparatory duties there directed to, fall down before God, and ſolemnly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the engagement there propoſed, and a verbal profeſſion of his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of God, &amp; his Son, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, according to the tenour of that form there drawn up and expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 2. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith a worthy Divine) <hi>God never makes a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

                        <hi>and individually, that all others are unconcerned in it, but with whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God enters into Covenant, that perſon is a repreſentative of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and is to be looked upon as a publick perſon; otherwiſe God ſhould make as many Covenants as there are perſons, which is the greateſt abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to aſſert,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is true, if it be ſuppoſed that God makes different Covenants as to the matter of them, as the Covenants of Works and Grace were; and this is the very ground upon which this paſſage was uttered, and that which it doth purpoſely drive at, it being ſpoken about the Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> and all mankind in him, and with Jeſus Chriſt and the elect of God in him: For as <hi>Adam</hi> in the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, ſtood as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of all mankind, that ſhould deſcend from him by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Generation; ſo Chriſt in the ſecond Covenant of Grace, did ſtand as a publick undertaker, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:132570:77"/>of all thoſe, whom God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Salvation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. But this doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that God may enter into Covenant with many perſons, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and individually, that Covenant being the ſame with all &amp; every one of them: not only with the perſon of the repreſentative himſelf, but alſo with every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon of that Collective bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy included in him; that is to ſay, every particular perſon of that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous multitude obliged to God, upon the termes of one an the ſame Covenant, in that common or publick perſon, may ſue out claim and appropriate, or apply to themſelves in due time the benefits thereof, and alſo, may particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſact with God, in an holy giving up themſelves to him, for the performance (through the ſtrength of his own grace) of that duty, to which they are bound in the participation of thoſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. So God did with all and every particular of mankind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant with <hi>Adam.</hi>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:132570:77"/>And ſo with every particular elect perſon in the Covenant of Grace through Jeſus Chriſt: theſe two do not interfere, nor claſh one with or againſt another, <hi>(viz)</hi> God taking ſuch a number though never ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, or many, into Covenant in the repreſentative, and yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into Covenant particularly, and with every one of them apart, and in their own perſons, inſomuch that every one of them may be concerned to lay hold on it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound in the ſame terms with the repreſentative.</p>
                     <p>Object. 3. <hi>But doth not this ſeem too much to ſavour of ſeparation, and look too much like that dividing pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſome in the Church, who, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, otherwiſe good men (as it is to be hoped) do yet gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of, and ſeparate themſelves from the Communion of the viſible Church, and enter into an expreſs and explicite Covenant one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? how may theſe two be ſaid to differ one from another?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> For the ſolution of this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeveral things are to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It will tend much to the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:132570:78"/>clearing of the caſe, to unfold in brief the nature of that expreſs Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, of theſe perſons mentioned; for by diſcerning what this is, we ſhall be the better able to diſcern the difference between it, and that we are now diſcourſing of.</p>
                     <p>For the nature of that Covenant (as far as by reading yet I do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand) it is this: A Combination or joyning together of ſeveral Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, by mutual Conſent, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and expreſs Covenanting (to uſe their own very words) to walk together with ſuch a body of Saints; in a participation of all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But to this we may ſay, as God of the Jews ſervices, who hath required this at their hands? to make ſuch a Covenant as this is? we cannot find any ſuch thing in all the whole Word of God, either Commanded by Chriſt, or practiſed by any former primitive Church. It is true, the Scriptures mention a general implicite Covenant of the Goſpel (as ſome Divines call it in oppoſition to that of thoſe Brethren
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:132570:78"/>fore-ſpoken of) or Covenant of Chriſtianity, which all profeſſing Chriſtians entred into, by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion unto the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, &amp; live in the profeſſion, of and hold to, whereby they are bound to acknowledg God as their only Lord, and Jeſus Chriſt as their only Head, Husband and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they will conform to all his Laws and Ordinances appointed in his Word: but of peoples openly Covenanting ſo to do with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and only in this or that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, as it were apart from all the reſt of the particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Catholick Viſible Church, we never read of: As fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable a judgment paſt on this practice as any I know,<note place="margin">Mr. Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Catholick viſ.

                     <p n="3">3. The conſideration and laying together of all theſe things, will help us to ſee wherein the difference
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:132570:79"/>of theſe two do ly, which is very great and manifold.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This expreſs Covenanting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to walk in ſuch a way, &amp;c. is not at all warranted in Scripture as this is, though not by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs precept, yet by propheſy, and practice of the Saints of God, as may be (before) ſeen; to which add one more of <hi>Jacob</hi> to all the reſt; ſee Gen. 28.20, 21. <hi>And Jacob vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vow, ſaying, if God will be with me, and will keep me in the way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and rayment to put on, ſo that I come again to my Fathers houſe in peace, then ſhall the Lord be my God.</hi> Which words are not to be looked upon as an indenting with God, or propoſing conditions to God, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he would (or otherwiſe would not) take or accept God to be his; but a choice, and ready ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of God, upon any (his own) conditions be they never ſo mean or low, according as he had promiſed to be a God to him, as well as to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:132570:80"/> 2. This open Covenanting <hi>(viz.)</hi> with this or that Society, is apparently tending to diviſion,<note place="margin">Mr. Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drey <hi>p. 101. 4</hi> laſt lines to the end of that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag.</note> and ſeparation, and thereby the members of one Congregation are parted from another, as to the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of all Goſpel-ordinances, but this is not ſo in this of our particular tranſacting with God, this being the only fruit to bring the heart more near to God, and unto a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conformity to his will in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Converſation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the term to which it drives, the one to a Combination one with another, and ſo to this or that particular Society, but the other only to a more firm union of the whole perſon, in heart and life, to God and Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They differ in this, in that they make their open Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be the formality of a Church-member, &amp; ſo this muſt follow, that a Church cannot be without it, nor are there any rightly admitted but in this way, which no-where hath a <hi>Probatum eſt</hi> by Chriſt, or any of the Apoſtles; but as to this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:132570:80"/>tranſacting with God (of which we treat) we ſay, that it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives being to a Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor yet to a member of Chriſt; for this a man may be, though this be not done as aboveſaid <hi>(viz.)</hi> a true member of Chriſt, and his Church too; only this excites to the keeping of the heart and life in better order towards and before God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The one is privately done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and a Chriſtians own heart, in his Cloſet, the other is openly done, before the Face of a whole Society.</p>
                     <p>The ſum of all is this: 1. The one hath warrant, Gods Word in the other hath no Foundation there. 2. The one tends to ſeparation, the other not ſo, only for a man to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate himſelf from Sin and Satan, to God and his Service, but not from any part of God's Church. 3. The one is abſolute, the other relative. 4. Without the one (if we believe them) no man can be a true Church-member, but without this formal expreſs doing of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:132570:81"/>a man may be a true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt and his Church too. Only let him look to it, that he true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believes in Chriſt, repents of ſin, and obeys God. 5. The one done privately, the other publickly and openly. I ſhall cloſe up all with a ſerious Wiſh or two about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. How could I heartily wiſh, that no perſon that is virtually in Covenant with God, were Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that Covenant, wherein he is bound to him. Ah! how many be there, that Conſider not at all that they are, nor know or underſtand what it is ſo to be. How ſad is it as to be Ignorant of all others, ſo of this ſo precious a priviledg, and comfortable eſtate! I wiſh that all perſons would ſeriouſly mind it more, and meditate of it, that they may apprehend, diſcern, and perceive thoſe obligations that lye upon them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How could I further wiſh with all my Soul, that thoſe that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:132570:81"/>cannot but confeſs, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg this, would not ſo ſlight and neglect it as they do, remember often that the vows of God are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready upon you in ſome ſence, as to your Baptiſmal Covenant and vow, and is this a light matter? is God's Condeſcenſion thus to vouchſaſe to deal with you nothing? is your reſignation of your ſelves, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to an holy God nothing to you? however you do make light of it, it will be requited of you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one another day.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. How could I again earneſtly wiſh, that every Soul would often ſeriouſly renew their Covenant with the Lord. Renew your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Godly Sorrow for your ſins and failings, and for your being unſteadfaſt in the Covenant, and renew your actings of Faith, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Mediator of the Covenant, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the benefits of his blood, the blood of the Covenant, which are the priviledges contained in the Covenant; yea further, that you
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:132570:82"/>would deal in this particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs way, debated here, proved, and evidenced not only to be warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but alſo wonderouſly profit. able, follow thoſe ſerious and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual directions propoſed by Mr. <hi>R. A.</hi> that ſo you may. once in good earneſt compleat this work.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Having dealt thus ſeriouſly, I wiſh you yet ſtill to be careful and watchful over your ſelves, that you do not forſake this Covenant, that you would conſider, what a weighty matter is done now by you, how ſad to be found a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breaker: often think how grievouſly God complains of ſuch perſons, Pſal. 78.8. <hi>And might not be as their Fathers, a ſtubborn, and rebellious Generation, a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that ſet not their heart aright, and whoſe Spirit was not ſtedfaſt with God;</hi> and further ver. 37. <hi>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant;</hi> and again. ver. 57. <hi>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their Fathers, they were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p n="5">5. Finally, I wiſh all perſons to ſee to it that they walk worthy of it, and anſwerable to it, in that holy, ſtrict, pure, and upright way of Obedience, which God calls for in that chearful dependence on God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and in that pure Converſation which the holy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant requires. Suffer not the remainders of unbelief in your hearts to cauſe you to depart from the living God; and let not that hand be lifted up againſt God, which you have lifted up to him in this tranſaction. Beware of your ſelves, that your practice and Converſation be no unſuitable, but every way conformable thereunto; that ſo you give not God cauſe to upbraid you, as we read, Pſal. 50.16, 17. <hi>What haſt thou to do — to take my Covenant in thy mouth? ſeeing thou hateſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:132570:83"/>and caſteſt my words behind thee?</hi> I wiſh unfeignedly that all thoſe upon whom theſe ſtrong and holy obligations lie, might have a Converſation alike to that of <hi>Levi,</hi> whom God commends as a patern unto others, and reproves the Prieſts for difformity thereunto: (I know this Covenant ſpoken in this place, had a peculiar reſpect to that Tribe) yet his holy Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is in a moſt ſtrict and exact manner poſſible to be imitated by every true Chriſtian in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God; ſee it recorded Mal. 2.5. <hi>My Covenant was with him of Life and Peace, and I gave them to him, for ohc fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.</hi> verſ. 6. <hi>The Law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips, he walked with me in Peace and Equity, and turned</hi> (himſelf chiefly, as well as) <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> (others) <hi>from iniquity.</hi> The Lord keep, and uphold us by his free Spirit, in an holy Covenant-Converſation,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:132570:83"/>anſwerable to our profeſſed, and I hope real Eſpouſals to God, and Jeſus Chriſt here, untill the marriage of the Lamb be come in the Kingdom of Heaven: <hi>Amen.</hi>

It is the great Commendation of the People of Iſrael: <hi>For what nation is there ſo great who hath God ſo nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things,</hi> that we call upon him for. Pſal. 145.18. <hi>The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him.</hi> The like paſſage in Pſal. 34.18. <hi>The Lord is nigh to them that are of a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:132570:94"/>broken heart, and ſaveth ſuch as be of a Contrite Spirit.</hi> This then is the firſt regard, wherein Gods People are ſaid to be Near to him; <hi>(viz.)</hi> God's Nearneſs unto them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In regard of Affection to them, he is, and is ſaid to be Near to them. Lord help us to believe it, God's People ſometimes can't hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe it; you know theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom we by love account dear, we account alſo to be very Near to us. Dearneſs and Nearneſs are here Convertible. Now God's People are <hi>the dearly beloved of his Soul,</hi> Jer. 12.7. in Original but one word, I have given the dearly beloved of my Soul. [<hi>Heb.</hi> the love] into the hands of her enemies. And that is one of the titles Chriſt gives his Church, throughout the whole <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Solomon;</hi> My Love, my Dove, &amp;c. So near to him the Church deſireth to be, that <hi>Song.</hi> 8.6. ſhe prays, <hi>Set me as a Seal on thy heart,</hi> What is the meaning of that? in ſhort, love me dearly, and love makes as ſtrong an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:132570:94"/>on the heart as a Seal doth upon any thing, to which it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; ſhe deſires to be near the heart of Chriſt, and that his Love towards her may have deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions there, as the names of the twelve Tribes of Iſrael, had on the breſt-plate of Judgment, which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron</hi> did bear on his heart, when he went in into the Holy-place. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.21, 29. Further, ſhe prays there, <hi>as a Seal upon thine arm, for love is as ſtrong as death;</hi> in which ſhe deſires alſo his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and Affection. The Lord expreſſeth the ſame thing in a like phraſe, to his Church: ſaying, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I have graven thee on the palms of my hands,</hi> Iſa. 49.16. I remember the Lord makes uſe of one expreſſion more, to ſet it forth by, the <hi>ſignet on the right hand,</hi> and that is near, in place and affection too. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.24. where the Lord ſpeaks of <hi>Coniah,</hi> one of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſaith to this purpoſe! <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord, though Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah the Son of Jehojakim, King of Judah, were their Signet on my
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:132570:95"/>right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence, &amp;c.</hi> A Man's Signet, that he wears on his right hand, what an eſteem and love hath he for that! yet ſaith God, though <hi>he was as the Signet on my right hand, would I pluck thee thence:</hi> Sin will make a ſeparation between a perſon or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though near to him. And that is the ſecond thing, God's People are his dearly beloved, and ſo they are near upon the account of Affection.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In regard of Relation to God, they are nearly related to God; there is a Spiritual kin, and alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his people, you ſhall find nearneſs and kin are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible in the Scripture. Lev. 21.2. <hi>But for his kin that is near unto him, that is, for his Mother, and Father, and for his Son, and for his Daughter, and for his Brother,</hi> and ver. 3. <hi>and for his Siſter,— That is nigh unto him,</hi> &amp;c. So that Kin and Nearneſs are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, words of the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:132570:95"/>
                  <p> Now there is a twofold Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwen God and his People, which makes the Kin to be ſo Near.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By Regeneration and the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the Marriage-Covenant; and bleſſed are the people, that are in ſuch a Nearneſs unto God!</p>
                  <p>Firſt by Regeneration, and the new-birth: that is one way the kin comes in, (if I may ſo ſpeak) and therefore you ſhall find through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Scripture, that they are ſaid to be born of God, and born again; and hence is it that all that are regenerate are called the Sons and Daughters of the living God, and who are nearer to us than our Children; theſe are the Children of God, being born of him. Joh. 1.12. <hi>As many as believed, to them gave he power, to become the Sons of God,</hi> How came they to be the Sons of God? ver. 13. ſhews, <hi>which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> So in the Epiſtle of <hi>John</hi> throughout, are they ſaid
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:132570:96"/>to be <hi>born of God:</hi> Now how near is the Father and Son, I need not tell you that are Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ents. So near is the relation between God and his People, 2 Cor. 6.18. <hi>I will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my Sons, and Daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.</hi> What a Promiſe is this! he will receive them to be as near unto him, as he will receive <hi>his own Son that ſerveth him.</hi> And what a deal of Nearneſs of Affection as well as Relation is there in this caſe, <hi>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us! that we ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1. You that are parents, think on this; when you ſee your Children in the ſtreets, or any where about you, Oh how are your hearts drawn out after them; learn hence, to be affected with the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, both of Relation and Affection, that is between God and his People; you cannot love your Children though your hearts run out after them, as God loves his Children; all the affection of all the parents in the World to their Children, is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:132570:96"/>but the drops of a bucket in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of God's love to his people and his Children.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By Marriage-Covenant are they Near to God. And this is ſo near a Relation, that all other kin are to be left for this Relation; they that are married, as to their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the fleſh, are become one fleſh, ſo near they are, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.5. Juſt as <hi>Adam</hi> ſaid of the woman, when God brought her to him, <hi>this is bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh,</hi> Gen. 2.23. Beloved, Gods people are his married people, and they are his eſpouſed people; full of this is the Scripture in many places. 2 Cor. 11.2. <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one husband, that I may preſent you a chaſt Virgin to Chriſt.</hi> Hoſ. 2.19, 20. <hi>I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth thee unto me for ever, yea I will betroth thee unto me, in righteouſneſs and in judgment and in loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulneſs, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 3.14. <hi>turn Oh backſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children, ſaith the Lord, for I am married unto you,</hi> Iſa. 54.5. <hi>For thy Maker is thine husband, the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:132570:97"/>Lord of hoſts is his name.</hi> Oh what an husband is this! Every woman is apt to admire her own huſband, but what an husband is this of Souls! Mark, how the Apoſtle doth improve this natural marriage to a Spiritual uſe. 1 Cor. 6.16, 17. <hi>What, know ye not that he that is joyned to an Harlot is one body? for he ſaith, ye ſhall be one fleſh,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>but he that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit.</hi> The Apoſtles deſign is, to take off people from Fornication, and the argument is taken from the deſign of God in Marriage: God made Marriage that there might be an union betwixt the Man and the Woman. Now preſently after Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, for perſons to run away one from another, for a Man to make himſelf one body with an Harlot, it ſubverts the deſign of God in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and the Apoſtle improves it, in the next words, <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit.</hi> A Spiritual myſtical Union there is betwixt God and his People, and I hope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that heard and now read this, have experience and aſſurance of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:132570:97"/>it, and the Lord grant that more may. And here alſo are both the Nearneſſes joyned together, not only the Nearneſs of Relation, but of Affection: if the Affection be ſtrongly knit between the husband and the wife, there is no Affection ſtronger than that, and no leſs ſtrong and faithful between God and the Soul. All which ſhews, that they are related to God, as near as any Relation in the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I may yet add another Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is not ſo near as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that are already mentioned, though near alſo; that ſets forth this Nearneſs between God and his People: and that is that of Servants, God is the Maſter, and his People are the Servants too; and ſome Maſters and Servants are very dear one to another, a wonderful Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Affection there is of ſome Maſters to their Servants, and of ſome Servants to their Maſters; though no Relation as to the fleſh by affinity, or Conſanguinity, yet they love them tenderly. I ſhall give you an inſtance of this in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:132570:98"/>Centurion and his Servant, Luk. 7.2. <hi>A certain Centurions Servant who was Dear unto him was ſick,</hi> and he ſhewed that he was dear to him in his tenderneſs of him, in that weak Condition he was; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelf to Chriſt for him. <hi>Moſes</hi> is called the Servant of the Lord, <hi>Moſes my Servant is dead,</hi> ſaith God, and you know that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>Moſes my Servant,</hi> is a token of the great Affection God had to him, and an high honour and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, that after he was dead the <hi>Almighty</hi> confer'd upon hm.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nay obſerve, in the laſt place that God's People are as Near to him, and as Dear to him, as any of our Houſhold, and Family are to us. And therefore are they called the houſhold, and family of God. Eph. 2.13. <hi>But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſometimes were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt:</hi> Compare this with ver. 19. <hi>Now therefore, ye are no more ſtrangers, and foreigners, but fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God.</hi> Yea to cloſe up this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:132570:98"/>whatſoever Relation may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Nearneſs and Dearneſs, in that Relation ſtand God and his People each to other; and thus is the third thing fully proved.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are near to God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Jeſus Chriſt; and that on two accounts:
<list>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:132570:99"/>near that he is his only natural Son, the only begotten Son of God; nay he is God himſelf, he is of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father, one that accounts it <hi>no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> Phil. 2.6. and therefore call'd <hi>God's fellow,</hi> Zech. 13.7. they are as near to him, as the members are to the body, 1 Cor. 12.27. <hi>Now ye are the body of Chriſt and members in particular.</hi> What a priviledg is here! you are the body of Chriſt, that is, the myſtical body of Chriſt. Chriſt hath a natural body, and a myſtical body, his natural body is that, which was made up of fleſh &amp; blood, formed by the Holy Ghoſt in the Womb of the Virgin: But then his myſtical body are all Chriſtians, who are as really his members, as his Hands, and Arms, and Feet, and Eyes, and Legs were members of his natural body. Chriſt is the myſtical Head of his Church and every believer is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical member of Jeſus Chriſt: how fully yet doth the Apoſtle expreſs this, to the ſame purpoſe, Eph. 5.30. <hi>For we are members of his body,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:132570:99"/>of his fleſh, and of his bone.</hi> He ſpeaks of the Marriage-Union in the neighbouring verſes, much like that of <hi>Adam</hi> concerning <hi>Eve</hi> his wife, Gen. 2. <hi>This is bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh.</hi> But ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>This is a great myſtery, but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and his Church,</hi> ver. 32. Further, if you obſerve the Nearneſs of relation they have to Jeſus Chriſt, it will alſo appear how near they are to God. They are near to him, in regard of their kin and allyance to Chriſt too; He counts them in the neareſt Relation to himſelf, and therefore they muſt be near to God by vertue thereof: ſee it in that full Scripture, Mat. 12.46, &amp;c. <hi>One ſaid to him</hi> (that is, to Chriſt) <hi>behold thy Mother, and thy Brethren ſtand without, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to ſpeak with thee.</hi> 48. <hi>But he anſwered, who is my Mother?</hi>— &amp;c. 49. <hi>And he ſtretched forth his hands towards his diſciples, and ſaid, behold my Mother and my Brethren.</hi> verſ. 50. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall do the will of my Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the ſame is my Brother and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:132570:100"/>and Mother.</hi> Now if they be Near to Chriſt by vertue of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Union, to him, as we have ſeen, they are in both theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards one together, and proved; then certainly, they muſt alſo be Near to God. So that that is the firſt regard, they are near to God on the account of Chriſt, <hi>(viz.)</hi> their Union and Relation to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are Near to God, with reſpect to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, in regard they are the purchaſe of his blood. They are his purchaſed people, and that makes them Near to God; he hath <hi>bought them to God by his blood, out of every kindred and tongue and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Rev. 5.9. by the Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, and by no other means, were we brought unto God. 1 Pet. 3.18. <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſins,</hi> the Juſt for the unjuſt, <hi>that he might bring us to God.</hi> We <hi>had</hi> never been brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, had it not been for the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, whereby we <hi>that were a-far off were made nigh.</hi> Eph. 2.14. Time was, when there was a great diſtance between God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:132570:100"/>and them, and when they were a great way off, what a ſad caſe was that! but being bought by Chriſt's blood, we were thereby brought nig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> unto God alſo. How ſo? Why, we were brought nigh unto God by Chriſt's reconciliation, which he made for us to God; by his death and ſufferings. And we ſhall be wholly and fully brought nigh unto God hereafter, when we ſhall be brought into the Kingdom of God, where God &amp; Jeſus Chriſt are, and we ſhall be with him for ever. Here are we brought nigh in regard of friendſhip, but not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that fulneſs of fellowſhip which we ſhall enjoy in Heaven. And therefore are we ſaid <hi>to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.6. <hi>while at home in the body.</hi> But there had been no enjoyment of God here, nor of the Kingdom of God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if Chriſt had not ſuffered, but now ther's both: this is the fourth regard, in which we are ſaid to be nigh unto God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are ſaid to be a People Near to God, in regard of their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:132570:101"/>liberty of free acceſs unto God; they have the priviledg of approaching nigh to the throne of grace, and thereby draw nigh to God. And this the Apoſtle lays down by way of Encouragement and Counſel in two places of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Heb. 4.16. <hi>Let us therefore come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help us in the time of need.</hi> And all this is ſtill upon the account of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, becauſe <hi>we have ſuch a great high-Prieſt, that is paſſed into the Heavens.</hi> Hence it is that we may <hi>come boldly to the Throne of Grace.</hi> Compare with ver. 14. ſo Heb. 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of Faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience.</hi> This is the great priviledg of Chriſtians, that they are made <hi>Kings, and Prieſts unto God, and his Father.</hi> Now you know the Prieſts under the law, it was their place, and office to draw nigh unto God; as doth appear by theſe two places of Scripture, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.3. where when fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:132570:101"/>had devoured <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bihu,</hi> the two Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> for offering ſtrange fire, <hi>Moſes</hi> uttered theſe words: <hi>This is that the Lord ſpake, I will be Sanctified in them that come nigh me.</hi> It was their Office to draw nigh to God, and for them to draw nigh to God with ſtrange fire, contrary to the very Command of God! therefore fire from Heaven came down upon them. See likewiſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.40. There, upon the occaſion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Korab, Dathan</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biram</hi> for oftering Incenſe unto the Lord, which thing belonged only unto the Prieſt, the Cenſers were laid aſide to be a memorial to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> That <hi>no ſtranger, that is not of the Seed of Aaron, come near to offer Incenſe before the Lord:</hi> Now Jeſus Chriſt having made us Kings and Prieſts to God, this is the great Priviledg, that we have by him, that we may draw nigh unto God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. and offer up our Prayers as Incenſe to God, together with all other our holy Duties, as ſo many <hi>Spirltual
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:132570:102"/>Sacrifiees, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1 Pet 2.5. <hi>Being built upon him a Spiritual Houſe, and Holy Prieſthood, to that very end.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is the perſon that doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nigh to God in our behalf. Jer. 30.21. <hi>I will cauſe him to draw near and he ſhall approach to me, for who is he that engageth his heart, to approach unto me! ſaith the Lord.</hi> Who is he that God will chuſe to draw near unto him? Literally and primarily it may be underſtood of the civil Governour, but ultimately and conſummately of Jeſus Chriſt, (who undertook not his Office without Gods call) who in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of believers, hath engaged his heart to approach nigh unto God, and we by him do draw nigh to God. Heb.10.19. <hi>Boldneſs we have to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus,</hi> with Eph. 2.18. <hi>For through him we both have an acceſs, by one Spirit unto the Father;</hi> ſo Eph. 3.12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſs, and acceſs, with Confidence by the faith of him.</hi> And what a Priviledg is this, that every one of Gods

                  <p n="1">1. Uſe of Information; this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers to us the great difference there is between Gods own Church and People, and others that are Worldly and Wicked men. God's Saints and People they are near to God, and all others are People far off from him; this is that difference that God hath made, between all the People of the World, and his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:132570:104"/>own People and Saints. And as wicked men are ſeparated and far from God, ſo are they far from the People of God alſo; they are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God and ſeparated in regard of their eſtates here, and the work is ſtill doing till the end of the World ſhall come; and when he hath done this in time, then ſhall time have an end: but now they are ſeparated in regard of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates only, hereafter they ſhall be ſeparated not only in regard of their eſtates but place alſo; on Earth there is no ſuch ſeparation, there is no poſſibility of being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeparated from the company of wicked men here; yea in the very Church it ſelf, whoſoever will be ſo, muſt needs go out of the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9, 10. hereafter the wicked ſhall be ſeparated to the fartheſt diſtance from God and the Saints too, that poſſible can be, they are here now far from him; <hi>The Lord is far from the wicked, but he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the prayer of the righteous,</hi> Prov. 15.29. what a Priviledg is that! that God is ſo Near to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:132570:105"/>that he heareth every one of their Prayers in the ſaddeſt ſtate, they can be here in the World! and what a Comfort and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is that to pray to God! there, God's hearing Prayer, is put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinct from God's being far from the wicked; and God is far from the wicked in this regard, that he hears none of their prayers, Pſal. 18.41. <hi>They cryed, but there was none to ſave them, even to the Lord, but he anſwered them not,</hi> according to that Joh. 9.31. <hi>God heareth not finners;</hi> that is, wilful and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent finners; but on the contrary, <hi>The Lord is nigh to all that call upon him, that call upon him in truth,</hi> Pſal. 145.18. the Lord is ſo near to his People, that he dwels in his People, Iſa. 57.15. <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth Eternity, whoſe name is bloy, I dwell in the High and Holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and Humble Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. While men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in their natural condition, God is far from them, and they are far from God. What a ſad
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:132570:105"/>condition is it, to be at a diſtance from God, did men but believe and ſeriouſly weigh it! on the other hand, this is indeed the high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of Gods People to be ſo Near to him. Even here in this World, what a great dignity, do people think it to be, to be near to a great perſonage, whether the King, or if it be one Inferiour! and indeed it is a noble Priviledg to be nigh unto the Kings Perſon, either in regard of kin or alliance, or to be converſant about him by way of attendance. And how greatly do they take on them, that are near the blood Royal in deſcent, or but near a Noble-man by way of ſervice? what honour and exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is it then to be near the living God in Spiritual kin and alliance! this is true Nobility, when God is the top of the kin, and Religion the root, ſaith one, and to be Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about the preſence of the Lord in Spiritual ſervices, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. It is the <hi>periphraſis</hi> or deſcription of Nobles, to be <hi>near the Kings Perſon,</hi> Jer. 52.25. in

                  <p n="2">2ly, God will fellow-feel with you too, if you are a People near unto him, and this Priviledg is as great, as the former; there is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Scripture for this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9. <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them; in his love and in his pity he redeemed them, and bare

If any be ſick, or in Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that be near to us, how ready are we to lay it to heart, how are we affected with it! ſo will God be with all our troubles, be they what they will be. And mark you, the ſame expreſſion is ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our inward Affliction, and remember it againſt the time that trouble comes; it is ſpoken of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Heb. 4.14. <hi>Seeing then we have a great high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Prieſt, that is paſſed into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Jeſus the Son of God. — For we have not an high Prieſt, that cannot be touched with our infirmities, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without ſin.</hi> He was tempted to ſin, though he was not

Sometimes the violence of temptation is ſo ſtrong, and ſo hard to be dealt with, that were it not, that a perſon could look to Chriſts fellow-feeling, and to God's pitty, it were a cauſe not to be undergon. I believe I ſpeak to ſome that underſtand, and experience what I ſay now; if we commiſerate thoſe that be Dear and Near to us, (nay and thoſe that be not ſo, but in the common bonds of nature with us) ſo that we take what hath befallen them, as though it had fallen on our own ſelves, how much more will God! and bleſſed be God, that we are nigh to ſuch an one that can fellow-feel with us, if not, we were an undone people; that's the ſecond.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third Priviledg is this, the advantage they have of prevailing with God, in the requeſts they do preſent to him; all their ſuits and requeſts ſhall be accepted and granted, and free and open acceſs to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:132570:109"/>his preſence to ask any thing of him, and not be denied, ſtill asking according to his Will. And hence it is, that they are ſo prevalent with God, becauſe they are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple near to God, and becauſe they are ſo near to him, that is, ſo near to him that is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; hence it is, that they can have all their Payers anſwered, an da l their petitions fulfilled, becauſe they are a People near to God; the Lord is near to anſwer all their Prayers; the Lord increaſe our Faith, for herein lyes much of the comfort of Chriſtianity. You know if a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger come to requeſt any thing of us, or an enemy, we do not ſo much as look on them, nor grant them (though it ſhould not be ſo with us, and we ſhould not do ſo) but if our familiar friend requeſts any thing of us, he will ſoon prevail; if a wife come, and deſire her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to do ſomething for her, or a Child ſhould deſire his Father to do ſomething for him, or give ſomething to him, though another ſhould not, yet they ſhall prevail,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:132570:109"/>why? Becauſe they be near to him. So it is with God, God's People are his Married People, his new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Children, therefore they have ſuch prevalence with him in all their addreſſes unto him. They may ſreely, but humbly Converſe with him, and may have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. God Commanded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.22. that there ſhould be a Mercy-ſeat, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Mercy-ſeat two golden Cherubims, and they ſhonld look one towards another; and when God did come and ſpeak to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the text tells us God promiſed, <hi>There will I meet with thee, and there will I Commune with thee, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Mercy-Seat;</hi> and hence the Apoſtle draws his encouraging argument, <hi>let us come boldly to the Throne of Grace,</hi> Heb. 4.16. <hi>that we may obtain mercy &amp;c.</hi> the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-Seat in the Old-Teſtament, is the throne of Grace in the New.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Their protection is ſure, God will undertake for their defence, which is much of the ſame impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the firſt; therefore I ſhall ſay by way of addition little of it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:132570:110"/>here; their ſafeguard is ſure, becauſe God undertakes for them; They are as dear to him as the Apple of his eye, and he that toucheth you, toucheth the Apple of my eye, ſaith God, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8. and their ſafety is ſet forth by their Nearneſs to God, yea under the ſhadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, till theſe calamities be over-paſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.1. I have covered thee in the ſhadow of mine hand. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.16. he ſhall cover thee with his feathers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.4. nearer we can't be, nor yet ſafer.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They being a People nigh to God, God will provide for them too, and take care for their ſupply; will not an husband provide for his Wife? and a Father for his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren? O God be merciful to a great many Husbands and Fathers, that have no Compaſſion on their Wives and Children, but ſpend all they get, and undoe their poor families! but God is not ſuch an Husband, nor ſuch a Father, God hath laid a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial charge upon Maſters of families, that they ſhould provide for their own houſhold; and if a man provide
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:132570:110"/>not for his own, and ſpecially them of his own houſe, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Faith, and is worſe than an infidel, ſaith God by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. How many ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Parents are there in the pale of this viſible Church, that have the badg of Chriſtianity upon them, that conſuem all in their luſts, and are in this ſenſe worſe than the Infidels, the Heathens, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans! now will God lay that charge upon us, and will he not do it himſelf? doth God require us to provide for our houſhold, and will not God provide for his? are not God's People his houſhold, and ſo his own, as near as Wife, Children, and Servants? and will not God then take care of them? Will God teach us providence, and care for our Relations, and ſhall not God do ſo for his? When you want your bread, you that are poor remember this, if you be a People near unto God, he will provide for you; and this ſhould learn you the Apoſtles leſſon, to caſt all your care upon him, who careth for you, 1 <hi>Pry.</hi> 5.7.

                  <p>Firſt, Labour to make ſure with the greateſt diligence and ſpeed you are poſſibly able, that you are a People near unto God. And will not all thoſe things that I hinted, and propoſed to you, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with you? may not the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:132570:114"/>of all thoſe Priviledges, that follow upon this forenamed, that you are near to God, allure us, and prevail with us? do not be at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from God ſtill, as you have been; may you not ſay truely <hi>It is good for me to be near, as</hi> David ſaid, <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God?</hi> Pſal. 73.28. run through in your meditations, every one of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges I have mentioned, be not hearers or readers only, be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then: methinks this one well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of before-named, of having every requeſt anſwered, ſhould be a mighty thing. It is a Priviledg beyond all imagination, ſufficient to Provoke to the higheſt admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and greateſt deſire, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour about this, that poſſible can be. But Conſider on the other hand, what is the miſery of being afar off from God, how great is the evil of being far off! why, <hi>They that are far from thee ſhall periſh, thou haſt deſtroyed all that go a-whoring from thee,</hi> ſaith David, Pſal. 73.27. well, it is a ſad caſe then to be at a diſtance from him. If we do
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:132570:114"/>ſeriouſly lay it to heart, and this is the Condition of every man &amp; Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as they come into the World, till Chriſt make them nigh; I pray God make you and me more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate of it: How long have you lived, and yet continue far from God! It would make ones heart to ake to conſider, how many years we have lived afar off, in point of reconciliation. Conſider one thing more, what Patience hath God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed to you all this while, that he hath prevented your periſhing in that Condition! what wonderful Patience, &amp; what a World of long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering hath God lengthned out towards you! Let me add one thing more, by asking you a queſtion, Will you live and die at laſt at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from God, and not be made nigh unto him? What do you ſay? If I ſhould ask every Man, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of you, as every one of you ought to apply the word of God to your ſelves, Art thou willing to live and dy and not be made hear to God? what do your hearts ſay to this? the Lord God of Heaven
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:132570:115"/>by his Spirit awaken every one to a ſerious Conſideration of it: I dare ſay there is never a man or woman, if they were going to die this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but would be of this mind, that he might be near unto God; unleſs God had given them over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a reprobate ſenſe, to be ſo blinded by the Devil in their wickedneſs, that they cared not what became of body, or ſoul, or any thing for ever. What a ſad thing, that many ſay in their hearts, with thoſe in Job 22. <hi>Depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledg of thy ways.</hi> Theſe do not deſire God, or to be nigh unto him: but now weigh this, as if you were going to die, Would I be ſet at a diſtance from God for ever and for ever? and can I ever expect to be near to God hereafter, if I am afar off from God now?</p>
                  <p>Weigh theſe things above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in theſe five particulars, for method and memories ſake.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You came every one into the World, at a diſtance from God.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:132570:115"/> 2. How long have you lived at a diſtance from him?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How much patience hath God exerciſed towards you all this while?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whether you intend to live and die in that Condition? or</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Whether you can expect to be near to God hereafter, if you be not near to but far off from God here? if you live and die at the ſame, yea greater diſtance, than you came into the World from God at, how far then will you be removed from God? and that for ever? if you be now ſo far by nature and continue all your lives widening the diſtance and pie without having it made up, you will never then come ſo near, as to ſee the face of God with Comfort. I beſeech you look to it, for theſe be the great truths, yea the greateſt concernments of your Souls.</p>
                  <p>Query. <hi>What ſhall I do, what Courſe would you adviſe me to take, that I may be near to God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Pray to God for the Spirit of regeneration, that thou
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:132570:116"/>maiſt be born of God, thereby thou wilt be made partaker of the Divine Nature; if thou art born of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then wilt thou be near to God; As near and as dear as a Child is to his Father.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beg of God, to communicate to you the Benefits of Chriſt's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. For it is the blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that makes us nigh to God, Eph. 2.14. <hi>For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and broken down the middle-Wall of partition,</hi> &amp;c. between God and men, as well as between Jew and Gentile. Oh that we might by Faith, and Prayer ſtill apply him to our Souls; <hi>He ſuffered the Juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us near to God.</hi> Now beg of God to bring you nigh to him by his Sons blood: I wiſh I could engage every perſon of you, not to lie down this night, till you had prayed this Prayer, that you might be brought nigh to God by the blood of his Son.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Lay hold on the Covenant of God, the Covenant between God and his people, it is a matrimonial
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:132570:116"/>Covenant, a Marriage-Covenant: now it is the work of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to be wooers for Chriſt, and to beſeech you in the name of Chriſt, to be married to him; and I deſire in the name of God to make this propoſal, Will you hearken to it and accept of it? God in his Word doth offer to be marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your Souls, God doth call you, you have every one of you run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God, and he calls you, as he did to Iſrael of old, <hi>Return you back ſliding Children, for I am</hi> (I will be) <hi>married unto you,</hi> Jer. 3.14. What do you ſay? Will you give Conſent or no? ſhall your Maker be your Husband or ſhall he not? ask your own hearts this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Art thou willing, Oh my Soul to be eſpouſed to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or art thou not? we are ambaſſadors for Chriſt, and he hath ſent me to invite you to him. And if this day there might be but one Soul brought in to accept of Jeſus Chriſt, as it would be <hi>the day of the gladneſs of his heart,</hi> Song. 3.11. ſo would it be the rejoicing of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:132570:117"/>mine. There is no ſuch match as this, no ſuch Husband as Jeſus Chriſt; how near if eſpouſed to God and Jeſus Chriſt! none nearer than Husband and Wife, the Lord therefore prevail with you. You have in the foregoing papers, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to and information of a Deſign of a worthy man, and Miniſter of God, propoſing in ſeveral treatiſes, advice about particular tranſacting with God, between God and your own Souls apart, not in word only, but in writing; and you have alſo a few things added to ſhew the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableneſs, and advantage of ſo doing: and I could wiſh that every Chriſtian in the World, might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with to do it effectually and ſpeedily, Bleſſed be God for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of it! never any one that hath taſted of the comfort of it would for any thing have it to do. Beſides the inſtance of one perſon, I have given in the foregoing <hi>Appendix,</hi> that in ſore troubles improved it, I ſhall here add one more of a perſon dying, whom when I came to viſit, being near to death, after I asked concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:132570:117"/>the parties ſtate, I ſaid I hope you are able to reſign up your whole ſelf, Body and Soul, into the hands of God: Reply was made, this have I done between God and my own ſelf many a time in a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and the draught between God and the Perſon, was ſound after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other writings, when deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that there is no greater preparative, that fits for, nor will there be a greater ſtay to comfort, and embolden, when at the point of death: What can be greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement hereunto, than the experience of the Saints of God, both living and dead? Up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and delay no longer, but do it, that ſo you may live, and die in full aſſurance, that you are, and ſhall be fully, and for ever, near to God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Branch of Exhortation. Let me beſeech you in the name of God, that have made ſure that you are a people near to God, that you would walk as a people near unto him. Firſt, make the matter clear, and then be ſure to have ſuitable Converſation; and that will be ſo
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:132570:118"/>if the former be done indeed, for the ſame Spirit of Grace that draws us to the one, will enable us to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Carry it towards God as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo great a Priviledg.</p>
                  <p>Query, <hi>But how ſhall we do that may ſome ſay?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Be ſure to have a care of that that will cloud your evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and aſſurance of Nearneſs unto God, and put you in your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions at a great diſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from him. You may get aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but then take heed, you do not meddle with that which will cloud it: time was you rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in God as your God, and your Father, that your ſelves were his Children, taken into Covenant with him, and into his family, in the neareſt relation to him. And when you are near to God, you will be ever near to God: but yet you may loſe your aſſurance by your ſin; for that will ſet you at a diſtance again, it being a forſaking God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from him; and ſo cloud your apprehenſion of Gods affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, your adoption, and regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:132570:118"/>and acceptation, and thereby rob you of the Comfort of your condition and all your relation to God; therefore have a care of ſin, of all and every ſin whatſoever, and ſpecially your own iniquity. Some perſons are addicted to ſome ſins more than others, ſpecially therefore take care of them, theſe will crack your peace, and cloud your eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: walk watchfully therefore, and labour to have an unſpotted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; for the ſpots and ſins of a mans Converſation will be clouds upon his Soul, and will blur all his evidences, and ſo break his Peace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Keep near to God as much as you can, and be as often with God as poſſibly you can. Do not carry it ſtrangely towards God: be often in Gods Company, and frequent in his preſence, often ſee his face, and draw nigh to him: my meaning is, be often in the uſe of Ordinances, and the Duties of Gods Worſhip; ſpecially in Prayer, which is a duty wherein God and the Soul draw as near one to another as in any duty
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:132570:119"/>whatſoever. Nobles are ſtill about the King, and if the King ſtir to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place without their privity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way they go, and poſt to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; ſo ſhould we, if God ſeems to withdraw himſelf: ſo the Church after her beloved, <hi>Song.</hi> 3. &amp; 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.8. <hi>My Soul followeth hard after thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Bleſs God for his diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Mercy, to you above many others, many thouſands in the World: how many are kept off, and at a diſtance ſtill, and what are you that you ſhould be made nigh to God, when many thouſands are yet ſo far off from him! I cannot tell you why it ſhould be ſo, only it is Gods good-will towards you; becauſe he will do it, therefore he doth it. There are thouſands and ten thouſands in the World, that have not this liberty to come near to God; they are in the ſame ſtate that ever they were, and enjoy not ſuch a Priviledg as this is; therefore ſhould we ſeriouſly conſider it. Mark what the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks, Deut. 6.7, 8. <hi>Thou art an holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:132570:119"/>unto the Lord thy God, the Lord hath choſen thee to be a ſpecial peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto himſelf, above all people that are upon the Face of the earth. The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, or chuſe you, becauſe ye were more in number than any people, for ye were the feweſt of all people; but becauſe the Lord loved you, and becauſe he would keep the oath which he had ſworn unto our Forefathers,</hi> &amp;c. and ſay within your hearts, why ſhould God deal ſo with me to bring me ſo near to him, and leave others in the ſame ſtate wherein they were born? let your heart be mightily affected with this Love of God, and kindneſs of God. Methinks I could dwell on the perſwaſion of people to this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they would be much more taken with the Conſideration of Gods ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing Kindneſs towards them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly be ſure to be humble and keep low; and that upon a double reaſon. 1. Becauſe that though you are a people nigh to God, of his free Grace, yet there is a great diſtance and diſproportion between
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:132570:120"/>God and you; for though you are brought ſo near God, yet you are but Creatures: whereas God is the great Creatour, you are <hi>but duſt and aſhes;</hi> God is the infinite, holy Majeſty of Heaven and Earth. Now the diſtance that is between God and you, ſhould dwell upon your hearts, and make you keep in a lowly frame ſtill, and ſhould Create ſelf-abaſing thoughts in you ſo much the more: The Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Priviledges, &amp; the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of God's great diſtance from us, ſhould increaſe our ſelf. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement. 2. And then upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our own ſinfulneſs we ſhould be humble before God. Micah. 6.8. <hi>What doth the Lord thy God require of thee? but to do juſtly and love mercy and walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with thy God.</hi> See to it, that you do walk more lowly, and ſelf-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly, conſidering what you are, on both theſe accounts, although God hath ſo dignified you. <hi>Amen.</hi>
